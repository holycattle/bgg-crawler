Normally, I'll dock part of a point because of issues like that, but this might be my favorite game of all time.  I'm not docking points for needing to use a Plano box, when this game has occupied all of my thoughts.  It's excellent.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Iguloy", "rating": "10", "comment": "Kickstarted. Standee version.  WOW. I can't emphasize enough how amazing this game is. Best game of 2017 for me, hands down. This is like a dream come true, I couldn't have asked for better. If you like Legacy games and dungeon crawls... please make yourself a gift and get this. You cannot not play this!  #1 BEST Dungeon crawl #1 BEST Legacy game #1 BEST Cooperative game  Also one of my SO's favorite games.  Update after 25 plays : I have now played 25 games of Gloomhaven on normal mode (23W-2L) in 3 weeks and I still can't wait to play some more. I haven't played a single other board game since I joined this amazing world. I prefer it with 2 or 3 players. With 4 it's a bit too long (I've played 1 game, but the scenario was pretty long also) but I'd need to try it again just to be sure.  Update after ending the main story: We have now returned to playing other games as there is less addiction to unlock stuff and since we \"finished\" the game. But boy this was the only thing we could get ourselves to play in 2-3 months. We played over 80 hours I'm pretty sure and we were playing mostly 2-player. This game has a lot to unravel. But for some reason when the campaign was finished we completely stopped. I must say the last two characters we unlocked and played were support characters and the combination in a 2-player game was less interesting.

{"username": "bwt2q", "rating": "10", "comment": "Gloomhaven is, at the time I wrote this, the #1 ranked game on BGG.  I think the consistently high ratings are well deserved.  I have really enjoyed the 7.5 games I've played so far (we're mid-mission right now!).  Gloomhaven is, first and foremost, a kind of optimization puzzle that you solve with 1-3 of your friends.  It has received much criticism because the puzzle is mostly the same, which I think misses the point.  This an excellent puzzle, with a large number of truly meaningful decisions, and scenarios that have very finely honed difficulty.  It's like a book of Crosswords or Sodoku - if you don't like the puzzle, a whole book will seem boring.  But if you like the puzzle, then it's great.  I find the puzzle of Gloomhaven to be absolutely enthralling, and the scenarios do a great job, IMO, of mixing it up enough that I don't feel like I'm just rinse and repeating my way through the game.  YMMV.  If you're thinking about buying it, you should know that you can play the first scenario for FREE with any of the first 6 classes on Tabletopia.  See if you like the puzzle before sinking $100 into it.  Aside from the main game, Gloomhaven's scenarios and campaign are really a labor of love, and it shows throughout.  There are way more enemies here than there really need to be, but it sure is nice to not fight the same 6 enemies all the time.  The standees work well, and keep the game affordable, so I appreciate them even if I still want minis.  Likewise for the character classes - 17 is more variety than most people will ever see, but it's there for those who want to explore.  I love that you are supposed to play the game to unlock the classes.  Each individual class has an individual set of higher level cards that become accessible as they level up, plus individualized perks that make their modifier deck better.  The modifier deck is brilliant, by the way, and the way you can improve it is simple yet fantastic - one of the many \"little\" touches that makes Gloomhaven such an amazing creation.  Lastly, I want to mention that I am currently playing Gloomhaven with my kids, who are 11, 9, and 7.  My youngest definitely needs a lot of help figuring out what she wants to do.  I give the 9yo some advice each turn about general group strategy and he plays competently, although not always optimally.  My 11yo plays with zero advice (he wouldn't listen anyway), and plays very well.  It's been a great experience.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "pixel pusher", "rating": "10", "comment": "Incredible game. Certainly not perfect and I had hoped for more outside of the combat, but what is there is very entertaining. Haven't tired of it yet.   The primary focus of the game is the card play for your actions and the optimization puzzle that presents. Things are dynamic enough that situation never plays out the same and you have a multitude of solutions to getting through things. It takes about 3+ play throughs to see all content. The reality is that your game is going to go differently than someone elses.  The game gives off a rpg video game vibe with branching story decision paths as well as which missions you choose to complete and when influencing how things play out. Fire Emblem/final fantasy tactics the board game? Less Baulders gate and more tactical strategy Jrpg mixed with some Mage Knight \"lite\". That may sound like the best thing ever to you or the worst.   Some may prefer games like Shadows of Brimstone over this game. Certainly do your research before buying this. This is definitely a euro game design style. No dice chucking.  Looking forward to what else this designer comes up with.  The version I got was $60 from the first kickstarter. A friend of mine wants it now but he has to pay $140. Ouch. It's a great game and if I had to do it again I'd pay the $140 but no more than that.  I rate the game a 9 because the legacy aspect makes a score of 10 impossible if strictly going by BGG's ranking descriptions. However I would unofficially declare it a 10 while you are playing it.  edit: I should also note that I find this game very compelling. Probably the most compelling board game I own. I want to play this every chance I get. I want to play it like I do my most favorite computer games. I have  board games I like a lot, but nothing this compelling to date. This game is really a 10 on my list. It is one of my top 10. Certainly one of my top 5.  edit: I have since found ways to make the game non-permanent. Removable stickers and resources have made it possible for us to replay this numerous times now. So I have bumped my rating up to a 10. Seriously one of the very best games I've played and owned to date.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The base of the game is it's tactical dungeon crawling mechanics and they are breathtaking. But what elevates this [i]masterpiece[/i] to the upper echelons of glory and immortality in the hobby is the legacy aspects. You aren't destroying things, you are [i]building[/i]. Improving the town, unlocking new (wildly varied) classes, slowly sussing out the secrets of the town, the world, opening envelopes, discovering secrets and watching it all unfold before you. Retiring characters gives you new experiences, both as classes and town/road events where you encounter your retired characters. It also gives you access to a book which further fleshes out the world. Some argue the game doesn't have enough story but there is enough there to enthrall me and help keep my interested in enjoying the marvelous system that Isaac Childres has created, and the world he has envisioned. Everyone I have put this in front of has said something similar, if you can find this for a reasonable price, buy it. Hell, even if the price is [i]slightly[/i] unreasonable, you should still buy it. It's worth every penny.  You can read my review [geekurl=/thread/1720130/welcome-gloomhaven-initial-impressions-now-50-less]here[/geekurl] if you're interested.

I can feel the immense amount of work that went into this game and for that I have changed my rating to reflect my view on the full version. Thank you Isaac for this game. Well done.  ----  I have only gotten to play the first scenario provided on Tabletop Simulator but I have to say I am sold on this system. It does so many things right its hard to list them all here. Removing the dice and making combat and movement card driven is perfect. Trying to figure out the combat initiative and which card you need to play first in order to pull off a great combo is just so satisfying.   Each character feels like they have something important to contribute and when Im looking at my hand of cards there really isnt any \"throw aways\" you are just really excited to try and figure out what to use when.  I also enjoy the elemental system and it doesnt feel tacked on it actually has some really nice in game consequences. The last thing I will say is the game is REALLY easy to manage and never gets in its own way with rule exceptions and a million little questions you need to look up this is a HUGE plus. The game plays smooth and lets you enjoy it without bogging you down.  Im leaving out a lot of things here that I love like the battle cards, the hidden character objectives, the leveling system, the monster ai, and the card management with discarding vs lost cards but these are all great innovative mechanics that really give a fresh take on the \"dungeon crawl\" style game.   I look forward to seeing how the campaign plays out but I can only imagine that will make the game even better.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "hish", "rating": "10", "comment": "This is like Fantasy Pandemic Legacy on crack. I think this is the first true RPG boardgame. It has the interesting decisions of a euro, the cool progression of a Legacy game (you can still reset the game) and the cool abilities and upgrades and excitement of an ameritrash game. It's over 90 scenarios, has a well written epic story, amazing art, road and city events that let you make decisions that change the world, so many classes that all play completely differently, etc. I can't believe this game exists! Its probably on the Mechs vs Minion level in terms of value!", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "jond", "rating": "10", "comment": "Ok, calling this one early... its a great game.  The game play is Mage Knight 'lite' with a massive persistent world, and many decisions to make.  The game is hard, but not in an arbitrary way - each of the 3 scenarios I've played has taken a different strategy to be successful on the 2nd play, as opposed to simply suffering poor luck.   Each of the different enemies and combination of enemies requires a very different strategy, and the decisions are non-obvious in most instances.  Overall, I've played this game for 12 hours already and i'm only 3% complete so at that rate it'll take me about 400 hours to complete the game. Will I make it? Ask me in a few years :)    Update Feb 17: Took it to a games weekend away with friends. We started with Gloomhaven at 11am and no one wanted to stop all weekend, we played 9 scenarios and no other games all weekend.  There are also clear signs of us getting better at the game - the slower progression really allows you to become an expert in your character and our win rate has climbed appropriately. The scenarios have all been sufficiently different and at LVL 5 my character is very close to fulfilling their personal goal.  March Update - just keeps getting better - there is no longer any 'brain burn' in the turns and the whole party operates smoothly with lots of table talk to decide how best to approach each situation. Unlocking new characters is fun, but also provides a pleasant spike in difficulty as you often are left dealing with non-traditional party make up which causes some fun tensions and often requires some creativity in which cards to bring for a specific scenario.  May update. 31 plays in, I'm completely hooked. Going to be playing this one until it's finished. Then I'll probably start again with a friends copy.   June 2017 - 36 plays in This is a Modern Classic, stone cold 10/10, all four people in my regular play group have ordered a copy, despite playing mine for all this time. Its dominated my table for 5 months, and its still all we want to play. Were going t be in this for the long haul until we finish the main story line at least, and then probably play through again making different choices as we go, playing other characters.  If you think that you'll like this type of game at all, and you will have the opportunity to play it then certainly pick this up, its a milestone in modern gaming.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for Solo only, unless you're really into that as much of the enjoyment I get from the game is the interacting abilities with 3 or 4 characters in play, and that would be a lot of mental overhead to separate out on your own.  July: Well my review comment made it onto the latest kickstarter video so I guess it was Ok :)  November 17: 49 plays in, completed the main narrative and after approx 150 hours my group has decided to shelve the game for now in order to catch up with all the other games released in 2017. We still have approximately 45 scenarios still to play and 2 characters not yet opened, so will revisit our world from time to time and it remains one of the best games I've ever played, and cant imagine turning down an opportunity to play.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "HyperionHuxley", "rating": "10", "comment": "Should you get Gloomhaven? Yes. Yes. [b]Hell yes![/b] Gloomhaven really is [i]that[/i] good. Gloomhaven is the dungeon crawling board game I've wanted since I first rolled-to-move in Heroquest 24 years ago. I don't think I'll ever touch my multiple boxes of Descent again, which is bittersweet to say the least, and a bit depressing considering how much money I spent on it. Gloomhaven is one of four games I've rated a [b]10[/b].  One reason I know Gloomhaven is special is that a friend I game with is obsessed with it, and he didn't even know it existed until about a month ago. He doesn't follow board game news and doesn't even have a BGG account and is thus unswayed by the massive hypetrain barreling through the board gaming world right now. He [b]dreamed[/b] about Gloomhaven. [i]I[/i] don't even dream about board games. He messaged me repeatedly trying to convince me to play more often (sure, just let me [b]abandon my wife and kids[/b] and I'll get right on that!) and bounced ideas off me how he could change his character's deck. He doesn't buy board games. He's backing the reprint Kickstarter.  There are some [b]downsides[/b] to Gloomhaven:  - It takes a long time to set it up and clean it up again. Solution: have an entire room dedicated to Gloomhaven. Buy or rent a new place if necessary.  - Gloomhaven has lots of tiny cardboard chits that have to constantly be manipulated. Solution: attach an extra cybernetic arm with tiny fingers ideal for fiddly bits.  - Gloomhaven has an FAQ longer than the United States legal code. Solution: study the rules like you studied for your final exams. That's right, get drunk the night before and say, \"Fuck it, we'll do it live!\"  - Gloomhaven requires (nay, [b]demands[/b]) that you sticker the map board and class decks, and that you destroy encounter cards when you're finished with them. Solution: get over it, you didn't complain that your stupid anniversary dinner cost more than Gloomhaven and that was [b]just one meal[/b].  But my [i]oh my[/i] does that all [b]fall by the wayside[/b] when you're deep into a scenario and trying to coordinate with your friends how the hell you're going to kill that boss with 48 hit points and HOLD UP what's that shiny treasure over there?! A Ring of SKULLS? And then you do the Vermling happy dance that you learned three scenarios ago on your way to the dungeon.  The joy when you pick your shield and retaliate ability cards when you're fully surrounded, knowing that your enemies will bounce off your shields and die to your scathing retribution. The agony when you realize that the enemies drew an initiative card faster than even exists in your own deck and they move in for the kill before you can raise your shields.  That moment when you think all hope is lost and we were so close, and wait, you can still play that card that recovers your lost cards? We got this!  The anticipation when you go to check out the side mission that you unlocked but realize that you can't go there because you haven't learned how to breathe underwater yet.  [b]Gloomhaven[/b] is life. That's the message I sent to a friend earlier tonight when he asked if I was available or if I was busy with my weekly Gloomhaven session. Of course I'm playing Gloomhaven every chance I get. I'm disappointed he even asked.  Gloomhaven played the game of thrones and decapitated the competition.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}
{"username": "Teamjimby", "rating": "10", "comment": "Oh man... This has already locked in my favorite game of the year.  It is an incredibly produced and designed game that happens to hit on many of my favorite mechanisms.  Let me list some of my favorite aspects.  :star: The core gameplay of choosing two cards each turn where you use the top half of one card and the bottom half of the other card is simultaneously simple and deeply strategic.  Combine that with the fact that some cards are one-and-done and you also naturally lose cards over the course of the game, and I find myself constantly making meaningful decisions at every turn.  It's kind of like [thing=96848][/thing], but less fiddly. :star: The enemies are awesome.  They are extremely variable (I think ~40 different types) and they each have their own strategy deck that fits their play style.  While most of the missions are just \"kill everything in the dungeon\", they feel very different because of how the enemies differ.  The AI deck is easy to use, although there are some strange corner cases.  This is 100 times better than having an overlord, imo. :star: Customization galore!  You get to choose your items, which skill cards to unlock, which skill cards for each battle, and how you want to customize your combat deck.  As someone that loves LCGs for the deck construction aspect, this scratches that same itch.  Similarly, I used to play a lot of D&D, so this feels like home. :star: There are so many things to unlock.  You start with 6 starter classes, but unlock another ~12 as the game goes on.  I am dying to see which character we unlock first.  Also, you retire your character after 10-15 missions, which is a pretty crazy idea.  But I've really warmed up to the idea and am looking forward to trying more. :star: It's a unique setting.  No elves, dwarves, etc.  Instead we have rat people, crystal people, elementals, and several other unique races.  I play a lot of fantasy games, so this is a breath of fresh air to me.  If I had to pick nits, I would say: :halfstar: The missions thus far are feeling a little same-y.  Combine this with the fact that character progression is a slow burn, and I fear my enthusiasm may decline a little bit over time. :halfstar: The writing is average.  Maybe I am spoiled by [thing=205637][/thing], but a lot of the writing in this feels like a cliche.  So far I'm loving it and can't wait to play more.  The legacy aspect doesn't really scare me at all because you can play like 60 or 70 scenarios and they are ~2 hours each.  This is only the second game that I've gone straight to a 10 rating (the other being [thing=115746][/thing]).  We'll see if it holds up for the whole campaign.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Pros: Only legacy game worth playing Really good mechanics Pretty hard gameplay Medium play time(per session) Lots of content Nice artwork Good value for money Too much stuff in the box  Cons No minis for enemies Too much stuff in the box  Would have rated this a 9, but got to give it a +1 for all those ppl who downrate due to their preorders being cancelled. This have nothing to do with the game and if Isaac where to blame it's for not being a psychic and knowing that he should produce lots of games.

{"username": "Redheaded Pharmacist", "rating": "10", "comment": "This game is quite simply stunning in size and scope.  My initial 9.5 rating takes 0.5 point off for minor complaints such as setup time, large footprint, and the amount of card shuffling involved.    I can easily overcome minor complaints to enjoy a truly amazing product.  This game has more content than several other games combined.    The action modification deck is a great game mechanism that adds uncertainty and randomness without feeling like things are out of your control.    The initiative system for determining who performs actions first is unique and works well.  Monsters also have initiative values on their action cards.    This game would be something special if it included a fraction of it's content and didn't have a legacy style campaign system.  The reality is the game is huge and the legacy mechanics are well implemented and don't distract from the overall gameplay.    This game really sets the bar high for quality,ingenuity,and entertainment.  Do yourself a favor and find a way to play this game soon.  You won't regret it.    Edit: Raised the rating to 10.  There's no reason in my mind this game doesn't deserve such recognition.  Really impressed.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Also just noticed Isaac has quoted me on his KS page. That's awesome! That's made my day. So pleased for you Isaac :o)", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Xonim", "rating": "10", "comment": "Incredible dungeon crawler with loads of scenarios. The action selection mechanism is excellent -- cards have a top action and bottom action, you play two cards but can only use the top of one and the bottom of the other. I didn't like the combat modifier decks at first -- it seemed an unlucky card draw could doom the scenario right from the start. But that's where the campaign part of Gloomhaven comes in -- you can improve your attack modifier deck through perks gained by achieving battle goals or leveling up. You can buy items or equipment to mitigate enemy combat modifiers. All you have to do is play a few scenarios, gain some gold and XP, and return to Gloomhaven to teach your character some new tricks.

{"username": "havok03", "rating": "10", "comment": "I tend to be generous with rating games, however this is my first and only 10 rating.  I had always thought that when a game deserving of a 10 rating came along, it would be obviously apparent.   That game is Gloomhaven.  I'm currently nine missions in, and my enjoyment continues to grow with each character upgrade, sticker applied, and envelope opened.  Perfect use of legacy mechanics, which are constructive, rather than destructive.  At first, I was afraid that the slow pace of upgrades would turn me off, but after playing, the pace feels just right.  I love being able to modify your attack modifier deck, in addition to leveling up and getting new card abilities.  With so many different paths to upgrade your character, your party, and the city of Gloomhaven itself, it feels like you are always making some kind of progress.  This is as close as you can get to D&D in a box, with no DM or advanced preparation required.  Arguably a better combat system than D&D as well, and every decision made feels like it was a difficult choice.  I've never been a huge fan of dungeon crawlers, as I had always felt like if i had enough people to play a dungeon crawler, that we should just play D&D. This game does what it does well enough that I feel it scratches a different itch, for me.  The rule that you cannot communicate specifics of what cards you will be playing to simulate the uncertainty of battle is fantastic, as it eliminates \"quarterbacking\", and sets up situations where you need to adapt how you perform the actions on your selected cards.  It's incredibly satisfying when your original plans fall apart due to monster or other player actions, only to find that you can use your selected cards in an alternative way to have an effective turn anyways.  Minor complaints would be component issues with the character boards, which we have replaced with alternative HP and XP trackers.  Tracking monster health and effects can be a little fiddly when there are lots of monsters present.  Also, setup/teardown can be a bit long, but after repeated plays, the rest of the group has learned how to set up and pack up everything, making it faster each time.  Thank you Isaac, Gloomhaven is a masterpiece, and is the tabletop game which all others will be judged against.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

But there is no doubt that the theme is through the roof and the ability for the game to change over time is there.   The highlights are the uniqueness of each character and how players must get to understand how best to play their character well in order to enjoy success.  There is also an engaging need to try and come to terms with how each enemy type behave, with the players being kept in the dark for some time as to the full actions of the various enemies.   We are only 9 games and I have seen some negative comments that the game feels repetitive over time and that the story lines are too predictable. Time will tell and I'll update these comments over time.   For now though we are thoroughly enjoying the game.  ", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

However, I wouldn't be surprised if this turns out a 10 pretty soon.   Most dungeon crawls that I've played are way too random and fiddly. Sure, story can be important too, but honestly I'd rather play a pen and paper RPG without any dice etc if I'm looking for a true RPG experience.   Gloomhaven is a different beast. It's basically a heavy euro puzzle (similar to Uwe's solo variants) that happens to take place in a dungeon crawl tactical combat theme, with a huge world that is really fun to explore. The core card play is what makes this game stand out though. It's so puzzly and can be really difficult and challenging. Needless to say, I'm very pleased so far.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

I will admit that it doesn't have a deeply immersive world that Kingdom Death Monster has, the world it creates is wholly original, but hasn't grabbed me in the same way.  The town and road events haven't been as interesting as I hoped but this is my only (minor) quibble with the game.    Now onto the good... Gloomhaven has BY FAR the BEST, most interesting, most unique, combat system in any game I have ever seen.  And combat is 95% of the game.  I love this game, possibly more than anything else I have ever played.  The characters are all very different, the customization is brilliant, the choices and decisions this game presents to players keep me engaged throughout.  Teamwork and coordination are really spectacular and I've only seen about half of the character classes.  I have a regular weekly group playing this and we sneak in extra mid-week sessions at every opportunity.  I deeply regret not purchasing this when I had the chance.  Update: This game just keeps getting better and better for me.  The amount of content in this box is absolutely astounding.  Thankfully I got a copy with the second printing and I now also play a solo campaign for myself in addition to the weekly campaign we have been playing for about a year.

{"username": "bcnevan", "rating": "10", "comment": "I have a copy from the first Kickstarter and have been playing the campaign at 2 players of and on for about 8 months now. It's an achievement.   The card play is not simply a timing mechanism. The card play allows for interesting decisions as you work how best to solve each scenario's puzzle. Some scenarios require quick bursts of powerful cards, other scenarios require you to slowly play your cards over a greater number of rounds. Further, the card play and the resulting actions you take allow for interaction--both positive and negative--with your other players that help bring the table alive. The monsters bring interesting wrinkles and meeting a monster for the first time allows for the feeling of discovery even after 30 plays of the game. The boss fights add a welcome amount of variation in the scenario progression. There's just enough world-building that you do feel the world opening up as you progress through the story-line.  The classes are a well-designed collection of abilities and don't feel like your typical collection of warriors, rogues and sorcerers. Further, the leveling of the characters provides a really fun power curve. You begin very reliant on the luck of your modifier deck, but as you level, you get, among other things, more powerful cards and more control over the modifier deck. Your character becomes much more powerful and you feel a sense of ownership over how that power manifests itself in your character. The game scales with that additional power so no scenario feels too easy or too difficult. The scaling is not static, either, so you don't have to play with the same collection of characters or players in each session.   The above-mentioned power curve and the character retirements are my favorite parts of the campaign. Each retirement opens up a new playable class and each retirement injects a sense of freshness into the campaign as you need to learn a new character and integrate it into the party.  There are some issues, but most of them are nit-picky or slightly cumbersome ways of injecting additional theme. For example, the nested definitions of the status effects are a mild annoyance (e.g., strengthen to advantage; muddle to disadvantage, etc.). The biggest gripe I have for the game play itself is that some retirement goals are very hard to achieve. Some players may be unable to retire a character for a long time. The game does provide a band-aid for this, since you can always just start a level 1 character from scratch and come back to that hard-to-retire character when the game state eases up on the retirement goal.   One word of caution: you really need to spend time before playing the game to establish a system of organization. Without organizing the game, setup would be brutal. The second edition rule book and component upgrades will fix a number of issues I had with the first edition (some of which I avoided by using my own component substitutions).  Add-ons/custom components: D20s to replace the damage counters; standees to replace the 1st edition standees; magnetic frame and markers to replace the 1st edition xp & health trackers; foamcore card caddies for the various sets of cards; tuck boxes for each monster type and other items;  Plano boxes for the tiles;  accordion file for the map tiles; and reusable replacement stickers.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "lordvoldemort", "rating": "10", "comment": "The game is a dungeon crawl with elements of a legacy game.  You are managing a deck of cards which you use to move, attack and heal.  It is very clever in that once you run out of cards you must rest with a long or short rest and then you permanently lose these cards unless there is some way to get them back which is very rare.  There is so much to this game I cannot list all of the mechanisms and rules here.    The game is great though and well worth the price.  It is a blend of Mage Knight, Descent, Legacy game and bit of Tales of Arabian Knights.  This blows Descent away.  I am really sick of FFG and their 100 page errata and poor balance in scenarios.  This game is really well designed.  It does not have the flashy monster miniatures, but really I don't miss them.  I would rather have clear rules and a balanced game.  This game deserves its high ranking.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}
{"username": "trexgorawr", "rating": "10", "comment": "This is the game I've been waiting for since I started playing board games many years ago. It's everything I wanted in a campaign/legacy adventure. Exciting tactical combat, rewarding character progression, great variety in play-styles, and it's just so much fun to play.  If I could nit pick anything, it would be the fact that set-up can be a chore due to the insane number of components (I highly recommend Plano boxes or similar sorting trays). But it's this wide variety of enemies, overlays, traps, tokens, etc. that keep things fresh, so it's worth the extra few minutes needed to set each scenario up and I wouldn't change a thing. So for anyone looking to grab a copy when the inevitable reprinting begins, I don't think there's a better bang for your buck in the board game world at the moment.

We cannot wait for the next game. At some point we will box it up part way through the campaign, force ourselves to play other games from the shelf - those games will be fantastic in their own way, then return right where we left off, rinse and repeat. We forced our way through Risk, Pandemic, and Seafall Legacy. 16 Gloomhaven games, each fresh, tense, and story worthy.

{"username": "jesusramos", "rating": "10", "comment": "Euro Legacy DnD in a really big box.  The story elements are interesting as you get a steady drip feed of happenings in/around gloomhaven as you take on scenarios and slowly uncover what's going on. The personal quests you get for each character add a bit of theme and an overarching goal to work towards and is an interesting way of adding a bit of player \"conflict\" when it comes to where to go.  The combat system is more like a puzzle than a hack and slash. You want to be efficient with your actions so you don't get exhausted and leave your friends while your character takes a nap. Battle objectives are a nice way to make you change your strategy as they are the way you unlock perks for your character and can sometimes lead you to do odd or selfish things just to accomplish them.  I really like the way the rulebook explains how you should communicate in combat, rather than giving specific values like saying \"I'm going on initiative 10 and doing a base damage of 5\" you should say \"I'm gonna go really fast and stab that guy dead\" which is a bit more fun to me at least.  Unlocking stuff as you go along is really cool and the game supports people dropping in and out between scenarios and people can even play multiple characters depending on the scenario if they wish. If people don't care for the story they can just drop into scenarios or drop out when they feel like which gives it some flexibility and even when you're done with the game it's still playable with others for their first time by just adding a character to the party (or just a one off scenario with no record if you want to do it that way).", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

I don't normally give out 10s for games but this isn't a normal game. The scope, detail, variability, and persistence are groundbreaking. If something changes with more hours logged I'll update again.  ORIGINAL Review (10 hours in) (9.5): I'm thrilled to play Gloomhaven. I'm only just beginning to work through the campaign, but already I'm hooked. I don't see another game overtaking this as my top game for quite some time.  Size: this game is massive, not just physically (largest box I own by a large margin), but in scope as well. It has the largest campaign I have seen in a game of this style while also including a random dungeon generator.  Mechanics: Finally an RPG/Dungeon Crawl style game that uses Euro style play. Hand management, deck building, etc.  Theme: The setting and artwork are simply stunning. It's immersive and beautiful. My son hasn't stopped poring over the pictures since it came in.  Value: Gloomhaven provides more value/$ than any game I've seen in print.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

GOOD. 4/12/2017: Still playing with the same two groups and started another 'alternate world' group to play through a different branch of the campaign. Just today, question posed 'What are we doing? Treasure, Power or clearing that nest?' and three people answered differently. I love this game. I'll also note that this was only one group, the second group isn't doing any of these three things.  The branching campaign path is definitely a positive here. In my estimation you need 4 playthroughs to play every scenario in the campaign because of how others get locked. 11/12/2017: Still playing this long with two groups a week.

Solid game play w/ meaningful decisions and very little reliance on luck. The \"legacy\" aspects make me want to rush right into the next mission just to see what I'll unlock next.  If i have any critique is that I'm not a huge fan of the element system (the idea is awesome but the execution is a bit fiddly, that said i'm only 5 missions in).  Also set up is a bit of a task, but should improve when I have everything properly organized.

The breadth of this undertaking, the sheer audacity and creativity, is unmatched in board games today. I will forever remember my experiences with this game, the late nights spent with my wife agonizing over the wonderfully deep tactical experiences it constantly asks of you, with nothing but fondness.

{"username": "emptycupoz", "rating": "10", "comment": "Richard and I had one play (I was the Scoundrel). I like how the characters are not generic at all and the card options and choices provide plenty of options during the game. I'm not sure whether I like the loot mechanic (even though as the Scoundrel it felt perfectly in character to run around stealing it all!) due to its tension with the working together to defeat the monsters, but it will probably take quite a few more plays for me to appreciate that design choice.  22/2 Played a second game in campaign mode as the Spellweaver (4-player game). I really like the way the mechanics interweave with a persistent world and the character progression feels about right. I was unlucky with my scenario objectives as they clashed with how I wanted to play, but that does provide an interesting tension too.  11/4 Played a third game in campaign mode as the Spellweaver (3-player game). This came right down to wire and I managed to use the wind jump ability to get to a good treasure chest, then improve my combat ability and kill the various enemies in my room before exhausting. Our last player managed to clean up the last few monsters to snatch a win from the jaws of defeat. Great game. Looking forward to playing again. Upgraded my ranking from 9 to 10.  July 2017 I bought this game second hand and started a 2 player campaign with my 11 year old son. I am a Mind Thief and he is the Brute. As of October, we've racked up 23 plays and are really enjoying this experience.  This was my most played game of late 2017. By mid-2018 we'd both retired one character.

{"username": "Keegod", "rating": "10", "comment": "The only downside to this game is the set up, and sometimes slightly unclear instructions.  That being said, this game is Isaac's love letter to board games. It's intricate card combat system, to the slow methodical upgrading of your decks, the overarching reactions the world has to your party's actions - this game isn't just something you break out once or twice a week for game nights to pass the time, it's a living breathing world where multiple groups could be interacting with eachother on a global level by opening up new locations and adventures. Quite literally it could almost be a different world if another group has a different mindset.  At first that can be offsetting, but it speaks to the depth of the game that it doesn't feel gimmicky. If anything, it adds to the sense of wonder in the world. Forget DND or an average dungeon crawler, this feels more like an elder scrolls story brought to life in a boardgame.  Combat is finely tuned and demanding, characters are varied and definitely unique in their capabilities. The campaign can take up to 400 hours, there's casual play or infinite dungeon generator if you just want to goof off and treat it as a normal board game. And that's important, because the first thing you'll learn is that this isn't a normal board game. This is a story that you're meant to be a part of, but at the same time you can just enjoy having some time goofing off and having fun. The mechanics are a little unwieldy at first but are easy to grasp once you jump in, and the first time you set up a personal combo with the crag by creating an obstacle only to smash it immediately to pummel your enemies with chunks of broken rock is an experience unequaled in board games.  My wife and I have played it every day since we got our copy, and have worked out tracker sheets so we can run clean campaigns for several of our friends so they can experience everything gloomhaven has to offer as well. If you have the chance, get this game. It's amazing, and Isaac Childres is a mad genius.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

It has a great way to set the difficulty level to your preference.  I love the character  building including your play card deck, items. and damage deck.  The story line is also good.  I lover that characters retire and you start new ones.  The one minor issue is that I  find that a lot of the items you find are not  worth equipping.  We are excited to open a chest open  to find that the  items in it are not nearly as good as the  starting items.  I hope that this  is corrected in future expansions.

{"username": "thaos52002", "rating": "10", "comment": "Yet another EDIT: We are over 150 hours played at this point and have unlocked all the classes and probably seen most everything the game has to offer. There are still some minor complaints (I wish there were some cooler unlocks to go after other than characters for example and I feel the game could use a couple of more Wow! moments) but over all we are still enjoying ourselves quite a bit. I suspect we are moving toward the end of the game at this point, there are only two classes that have no been retired at least once and we are nearing the end of the major plot lines. I say we have played \"over 150 hours\" but I really stopped counting around 120 so I have no idea how many hours exactly we have played. For a group that owns 300+ board games and generally considers it worth having purchased the game if we get in 10 plays before it gets shelved, Gloomhaven is certainly our most played game ever and is probably the only game that all four of us would rate a 10.  Another EDIT: We are nearly 100 hours of game play (kind of lost track of exactly how much time we have put into this game) and it's still pretty awesome and I still look forward to getting it out every week.  EDIT: After over 40 hours of game play we have only come up with a few things that we truly disliked. The way advantage interacts with rolling modifiers, the blitz that occurs at the beginning of a scenario (or sometimes when you open a door), the disparity in speed for some characters (sometimes it just seems a character cannot be fast enough to do what the character seems it is meant to do) and how easy it is for some characters to get loot and XP and how hard it seems to be for other characters. None of these things are remotely deal breakers however and over all we are still very excited to continue and see where things go. Two characters have retired at this point and the way the group is forced to change is quite intriguing.    Original Post: I can't say this will stay a 10 for me forever and of course the legacy aspect means that it could dip simply because of what comes next (Pandemic Legacy fell pretty hard after completing the campaign and finding it less than fulfilling) but at the moment this game is amazing.   We have two people in our group that have always wanted to play more of the so called D and D in a box style games but in general co op games do not appeal to the other two members of the group. This is even more true when you are looking at games that are move, roll dice, kill stuff... repeat. If there isn't enough decision making they simply wont last.  However Gloomhaven has a lot of decision making and the legacy aspect helps it immensely.  All four of us are enjoying this game and while there have been a few complaints (the Scoundrel character seems to get more XP AND more gold than the rest of us being probably the biggest gripe) over all this game has been a massive success.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "AgentOddball", "rating": "10", "comment": "(No Spoilers)  This game has been an absolute smash hit with my gaming group.  It's everything we wanted, and more.  Cooperative games sometimes have trouble with getting the difficulty curve right, many times tuned to make it come down to the wire so much that winning or losing feels random.  The difficulty balance in Gloomhaven is top-notch, though!  It rewards clever play, and you can sail through a scenario on one or two well-orchestrated turns, or take a terrific beating if you just try to phone it in with hack n' slash tactics.  Plus, you can optionally tweak the suggested challenge up or down per scenario, and receive increased/decreased rewards as payment.  Fantastic!  Without talking about what they actually are, we're all extremely pleased with the unlockable classes.  You don't just get more of the same, and the variety of play that comes from the unlocks keeps the game fresh and exciting.  We all love our characters so much that we almost don't want to retire them, but the allure of a new discovery always wins.  This is my fourth 10-ranking, and Gloomhaven absolutely deserves it.  I never want it to end.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Not a 10 only because I think of 10s as final decisions, and you can't reach a final decision on something astonishing like this without a lot of play, or maybe even until it's done.  Maybe we'll become hungry for something different after repeated play, maybe this one sticks to your bones just as is, or maybe it keeps a steady diet of new tactical challenges coming your way.  At present it looks about as nourishing a game as you could hope for.  Update: it's a clear ten for me now.  A great achievement.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Scenarios are difficult as most coops usually are but not impossible. (Playing on normal difficulty) It just takes careful consideration and planning.   Road Events and City Events are interesting in that doing certain things will add other city/road events into the current deck to reflect the choices you've made.   The only drawback I can see is that set up is a huge pain as there are so many pieces and bits.

{"username": "PBrennan", "rating": "10", "comment": "50+ plays. There's a lot to love about this game. It's a tactical dungeon crawler, sure. But the decisions each turn are really hard and meaningful (unlike most dice-based dungeon crawlers which are more play-it-for-the-ride games). It can be agonising trying to get the right action combination for yourself and for the team for this moment and keep enough powder dry for future. There's just the right amount of variance for your plans to play out mostly as expected but with enough surprise to maintain tension. I've tried the random dungeon generator, but setting up each room (with new monsters) is too tiresome so I won't be pulling it out for casual gaming. However I'm a legacy campaign fan, hence the purchase, so I'm looking forward to becoming more engaged with the storyline and letting it paint a context so the game becomes more than just the tactical endeavour. If it's just glossy background, the game will diminish for me; if it can portray a real world and my position in it, the more I'll enjoy. I'll be giving it every chance.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

To understand what I just said; one will have to play it at least once using the Human Scoundrel...I highly recommend this game!", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Playing it co-op is a much better experience than playing it solo. Great game and I thus increase my rating. Played one game and lost. Very very close game. The scenario came to who had the lowest initiative. My lasy standing hero had a slightly higher initiative and yhe baddie stoke first. I was learning the rules of discard vs losing cards. In other words, I messed up and was punished for my mistake and that is great stuff. I will play again tonight. So far I am enjoying the game.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "edhc", "rating": "10", "comment": "This game is a work of mad genius and the passion that Isaac Childres poured into its making is clearly visible. The sheer scope of the games - over 90 adventures, over 40 types of monsters, dozens of items and over 15 characters, each with their own deck of cards - is awe inspiring.  The game is so huge that the legacy aspect is an added perk rather than a drawback (for those who don\u2019t like altering a game); exploring and having that sense of discovery and wonder and \"wow\" factor as with a role playing game is a definite plus. It doesn't really strike me like the sort of game you play through multiple times. At its core it\u2019s a skirmish dungeon crawler, and in its mechanics it\u2019s a deck builder. There are no dice in this game and the random factor is introduced using modifier decks that add or subtract from the main result. The game is very impressive, as each round requires thought as you choose which cards to play and how. Its not a beer and pretzels game, you really need to play smart or the adventures will chew you up. This is a massive game and provides a massive experience. Hats off to Isaac Childres!!!", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "sfcolorado8", "rating": "10", "comment": "A perfect rating is something I almost never feel waranted in giving out, however rare exceptions can happen in extreme cases, and this happens to be one. Isaac has created something quite remarkable with what I'm sure will be long remembered as his Magnum Opus in game design. A tactical and strategic Euro game masquerading as a traditionally Ameritrash fantasy style battle romp. And he accomplished both goals in spades. I can't really stress that final point enough. My game preference is mostly focused on Euro strategy, but I do have gamer friends that are largely if not solely interested in Ameritrash. To find a game that so brilliantly appeals to both camps, with such an enormous amount of content and replay ability, is almost unheard of (at least to this date).  Thank you Isaac for this rare and incredible gift to the community... You deserve all the praise and accolades you are already receiving and I'm sure will continue to as more and more get exposed to this amazing creation. Hats off...  Updated... Many reviewers have been calling this early as the 'game of the year'. That description doesn't really do it justice though.

{"username": "astalis", "rating": "10", "comment": "First of all i dont give 10s easily. Its the 4th one, after Pandemic legacy, Cosmic encounter and Kemet. All for different reasons.  Why 10? -Value for money. I am not sure this game provided any profit to Isaac himself. Seriously 100 euros for this 10 kgs box with the plethora of items it includes, its a joke. -Its a legacy game, and its a legacy game that can be played again. Not sure if i ever make it to the end, but giving you the option to reset it seems great to me. -Great battle system. Card combos are there but its very crucial to use them wisely and dont lose the cards early. Very smart.  -The different characters do feel very different. Their playstyles are not similar with each other and feel very thematic. -Absence of dice.  -Its very close to Mage knight, except that it lasts 3 hours less. I love Mage knight too, dont mistake me, but Gloomhaven its more appealing with its shorter play time and legacy features implemented. -The attention to detail in this game is amazing. Road and city events, personal quests etc etc , these stuff could be missing and still Gloomhaven would be great. But Isaac just wanted to make the best board game ever, and he probably achieved it. -This board game comes as close and it gets to an rpg video game. I ve played many rpgs on the past and i can clearly see that.  *I dont think i can find any negative in this game. The only thing that  its a bit annoying is that all these components give me hard time settle them back in the box after finishing the game.    *Bought plano box for standees + additional box for map tiles.  *Painted minis  *Added painted furniture  *Bought health and xp dials.  *Bought removable stickers", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

When I felt this, I've only read the rule book and opened the box. The imagination, ingenuity, simple innovation, and outstanding heart put into this game, is just incomprehensible.  The box is about 20-25lbs. There is more content in this box than every board game I've ever ever seen.  The depth in which the game unfolds as you play, is incredible. The choices you make leave a legacy for future players and future groups. Each character has their own motivations, goals, ambitions.  Each scenario unfolds more of the world, uniquely altering the global agenda of your campaign.  Side quest scenarios open up. Random Dungeons can be populated. Tailoring your progression to your desire to move the story forward. ----  I'll end my review here by saying. This is probably the greatest game I have seen.  My wife and I will strive to unlock the hidden secrets of Gloom Haven, and eagerly await the expanded world.  Please continue", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "felherc", "rating": "10", "comment": "One game to rule them all! I am so glad that it finally dethroned Pandemic: Legacy from BGG's No. 1 spot. :) The core battle system, which feels like a much-enhanced Mage-Knight-meets-Mice-&-Mystics,  hits all the sweet spots in terms of strategy, tension, variety, cooperation, and discovery. Even though obscuring the basic actions of your everyday dungeon crawler behind the multi-use cards results in an awkward initial experience, the system leads to a highly enjoyable explosion of tactical possibilities and puzzle-solving challenges.  And it does not stop there. This ridiculously-big box keeps throwing cool stuff at you, from eye-watering variety in playable characters, monster types, and unique scenarios to original encounters, meaningful choices, world-building events, and customization possibilities that make the world of Gloomhaven come to life on your table. And then there is the ability to have players jump in and out with straightforward re-balancing, to have concurrent questing parties, and to have solo, casual, and random playing modes. Childres is certainly The Grandmaster of game design for the sheer quality and quantity of gaming elements in his creation. I am hard-pressed to find legitimate negatives in this game, as it seems like not much could be changed without compromising one of its many great features...

Well just from opening it, and seeing it packed, you know this was a labor of love!  A 10 just for packing!  Components very good, then the reading the rulebook, you know a great experience was coming.  7 games played (2 do overs on a side quest) and myself and my two 20 something daughters just love this game.  So well put together!  Playing Spellweaver, Brute and Scoundrel, good combination, and after 7 games we all feel like we are kinda of getting our potential...but then again!

{"username": "csb249", "rating": "10", "comment": "+ Gives me what I want in a dungeon crawl with more decision making than \"move, roll dice, roll defense dice.\" Crunchy and euro-y but still exciting.  + Don't generally love pure co-ops due to potential quarterbacking and the feeling of losing to the game rather than another player. This circumvents that by making it near impossible to quarterback, and suggestions feel more like working together rather than making someone's move for them. Win rates stay high since adjustable difficulty maintains tension and losses still result in gained xp, perks, etc  + Legacy format works well for drop-in and drop-out. We have 6 rotating players and it works great. Printed 2 extra attack decks for ease.   + Tons of content that will last my group years.  + Exciting classes that feel like an interesting puzzle to play, with the three legs being the enemies, your character, and your allies and how they all work together.  + Plays great at all player counts   - Don't care for scenarios that incorporate more than four or so enemies as things can get a bit overwhelming and fiddly  - obviously, long setup time makes it hard to break out unless planned in advance, but this would be hard to avoid while still maintaining this amount of content. Some easy home adjustments make setup for palatable. ", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "SiddGames", "rating": "10", "comment": "[BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]SoloX.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]   Man, sounds really good. This may be the first Kickstarter I really regret not getting in on.  Update: reprint coming to Kickstarter in April 2017. Woot!  Update: backed the second printing on KS, due for [-]August[/-] November 2017 delivery.  Update: holy smokes. Believe the hype. Three of us tackled this over the holidays. Punching out and sorting alone was at least a half hour, and even after watching some videos our first scenario run was easily 2+ hours and we lost. It's not really that complicated though and we played twice more in the same night at around an hour per scenario.  Gloomhaven is \"just\" a dungeon crawler with a campaign system, but saying so is really a disservice to how terrific the game is. The Euro-y combat mechanics are fantastic, the monster AI and bookkeeping is smooth, the character progression system and campaign are very well done - everything is just excellent and feels polished to the nth degree. Even the fact that the designer made his own world and didn't quite stick to traditional fantasy tropes (no orcs and dwarves, no traditional classes like fighter and cleric - the Scoundrel is the only thing I've seen so far that seems pretty similar to a standard fantasy Rogue) helps set this apart.  Gloomhaven is the best dungeon crawler / pseudo-RPG game out there, hands down. So glad I bit on the second Kickstarter to guarantee myself a copy.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "arod324", "rating": "10", "comment": "57 sessions in (46 unique scenarios): Still going strong and so many of the new characters are really awesome.  Some of the \"kill everything\" missions are somewhat repetitive, but with new characters and party compositions, it is super super fun.  Just went through a scenario where 1/2 of the monsters are available on any given turn (phase in/out of existence).  27 sessions in (24 unqiue scenarios): Upgraded to 10/10.  I can't stop thinking about this game and want to play it more and more.  Four characters are now retired and 5 unlocked characters (took 13, 22, 20, and 19 games to retire each character respectively). Depending on some of the goals, party make up, and other factors like which missions are available, there can be wide ranges in how long it takes to retire your character. There are lots of variations in terms of classes and different play styles and look forward to trying more!   14 sessions in (11 unique scenarios): Playing with the lower variance version (2X and 0X treated as +0).  This is a game that I keep on thinking about.  Could I have played it different and what combos do I want to put into my deck for X type of threat vs. Y type of threat?  We have only unlocked envelope B and two side scenarios.  I can't wait until we unlock the Power of Enhancement and new classes (no one has retired yet).    It plays extremely well with 3 and 4, but is a bit longer with 4, especially when there are lots of little monsters or NPC allies fighting with you.  With 3 you can get a scenario done in 1:30-2:00 fairly easily.    Minor Issues: I wish there was a better way to mitigate some of the monster attack draws.  In one scenario we had 4 of monster X summon a monster Y each the turn they were revealed.  They then had the same action the very next turn and also proceeded to start healing them.  After the first batch, it was pretty much unwinnable and when we did it a second time we breezed through it.    2 Sessions in: Initially an 8, but strong potential to go up after more sessions. I've been itching to play it and thinking of all the strategies and card combos while not playing it.  Will be playing with the less randomness variation in the future as the 2X and null have a very large impact and prefer the more tactical approach.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}
{"username": "MedicTank", "rating": "10", "comment": "Great design by Childres here. Game is an awesome dungeon crawl that makes you think of Tactic Ogre or Final Fantasy Tactics converted in board games. Some of the components haves issues notably health and xp markers, but there was no way that such a massive game at such a reasonable price could have happened with all premium components. Communication and customer support by Isaac Childres have been absolutely stellar. This could be worthy of being his magnum opus and hopefully it won't be because he will design even greater games.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

I've played probably hundreds of games with tactical combat. Miniature games, RPGs, other dungeon crawlers, I'm even counting video games here and I think Gloomhaven is clearly the best. Every turn provides an interesting decisions, the classes are extremely varied and interesting with their own playstyle, something as simple as one item can enable whole new strategies and avenues of play.  But it's not just that. This brilliant tactical combat is encased in a larger game that is probably one the most comprehensive single box campaigns ever created.  It boggles the mind how a single designer working alone could make this game. Kudos to Isaac on this massive achievement.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "maumastoks", "rating": "10", "comment": "Most easily summarised as a mixture between Mage Knight, Dungeons and Dragons and Mansions of Madness with a legacy system and an ongoing storyline. Play mechanics are really brilliant - you've got limited amount of cards and have to use 2 of them per round - one upper and one lower part, balancing them out to ensure cards are lost when it is needed (Mage Knight part), the figure control on the map walking through tiles interacting with objects and fighting (Mansions of Madness part) all while being involved in quite a lengthy storyline that takes in your actions, opening new path and closing others (d&d, legacy). It is indeed a well-balanced game requiring deep strategical and analitical thinking on-the-go as the situation is constantly changing. Drawbacks: no first-game rulebook - you have to read the mechanics before playing, a steep learning curve since it implements lots if mechanics. However the main drawback is the fact that it is a heavy legacy game. Not only you need a permanent party willing to constantly play (unless you want to play this game for years and with different people as old ones leave) as well as wiling to learn a heavy game. Better fewer people more willing to play rather than going through a recruitment hell every time you want to play. There is a possibility of playing some parts of this game with random people that are in just for a run or two - doing side-scenarios or random dungeons but I highly recommend saving the main storyline for the permanent team. Still, I consider this as a must-have for heavy gamers that constantly have 2-4 active and willing players.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "katanan", "rating": "10", "comment": "I was pretty skeptical of the hype for this one, but it definitely surpassed my expectations. My most played game of 2017, and I\u2019m not even close to burning out on this game. Never was taken by any other dungeon crawl or tactical combat game I had played before. But the clever card play, building up your character and modifier deck, and just how differently every character plays is amazing. The hand management aspect is the core part of the game where your hand of cards is actually the game timer. The prospect that you can exhaust yourself pushes you to be very aggressive and also makes the choices tough because if you use a very powerful card it is removed from the game, but losing cards too early can mean you might exhaust before finishing the scenario. Amazing game and a well deserved #1 on BGG. Definitely prefer this at the full four players though, allows for nice synergy between strengths of different classes.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Trantor42", "rating": "10", "comment": "It's like Isaac looked into my head, asked himself \"Hm, what would this guy like?\", and then designed Gloomhaven based on that. I've played it over 60 times in 5 weeks and am still totally addicted. In fact, I can't wait re-starting the campaign with different characters and different choices. Thankfully, my wife is just as enthusiastic as I am.  I love the core hand management mechanic, the optimization it requires. Characters and monsters vary greatly, there is always room for tweaking, improving, optimizing. The campaign is also great, but make no mistake: The game is 90% tactical combat.   There are some downsides, though: - Setup is *very* long, even with a good storage solution. - Scenario variety could be better. There are some great, creative ones; I just wish there were more of them and less of \"Kill all enemies\".  - Some characters are more suitable for 4 players than for 2.   But even if there is still improvement for the expansion, this is still the most brilliant and addictive boardgame I have ever played.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "CaiusDrewart", "rating": "10", "comment": "Recently got a chance to play this highly-acclaimed game. I played some 3-player (~15 scenarios) and a lot of 2-player (~30 scenarios). From the starter classes I played the Cragheart (twice) and Scoundrel. I also played two of the unlockable classes, which I won't spoil here.   I think Gloomhaven is an excellent game that mostly lives up to the hype. The following elements are particularly strong:   --The tactical combat is very good. Each round you choose two actions from two different cards in your hand, so there's lots of interesting choices to be made. Now, you do settle into certain patterns after a while, and after enough plays it can feel a little repetitive. But it's a strong, compelling system.   --The dynamic of lost cards and exhaustion works well. You have access to some powerful one-time effects, but you have to ration them: if you use them too aggressively, your character runs out of steam before the mission was complete. A great system, although for a lot of classes I would say that loss cards are a little underpowered compared to non-loss cards.  --Almost every scenario presented interesting choices about whether to maximize rewards (by looting more) or to maximize odds of victory. A fun dynamic. You can also introduce a semi-competitive element into the game by competing for loot, if that sounds fun. My group didn't do that.  --Character advancement is terrific and is probably my favorite part of the game. Adding new cards, upgrading old cards, gaining perks, and purchasing items is great fun. Each character makes rapid progress in exciting and dynamic ways.   --While the retirement system had its issues (see below), on the whole I thought it was a really neat idea. I liked the opportunity to play different characters and the dynamic of a constantly evolving group. Some of the retirement quests work well from a thematic perspective, too.  --Unlocking new classes was always an exciting moment-- and the unlockable classes did not disappoint one bit.   --The story elements behind the various scenarios were surprisingly decent. I was impressed. We often had multiple compelling paths to choose from.  --The diversity of both classes and monsters was impressive. Each class played provided a fresh experience.   --I'll single out the Cragheart class as a particularly impressive piece of design. It's fun, flavorful, and original. Starting at level four, the Cragheart can reshape the battlefield in really cool ways.   --l like how forgiving the game is. Character death/exhaustion is no big deal; no permanent effects at all, and you even get to keep any rewards you acquired during that mission. If the group fails a mission, just try it again, either now or later. While this lowering of the stakes may not be to everyone's taste, it definitely makes the game more fun for me.   --Game difficulty is very easy to adjust, which is nice.   But there are flaws. Here are some things that worked less well for me:   --Options felt more limited with two players. There were whole classes, like the Tinkerer, which basically became useless, as well as a large number of cards and class abilities that stopped functioning well. A fair amount of the game's content became worse at this player count. I thought the game was much better with three.  --The need to manage monster movement, shuffle monster decks, calculate a large number of attacks, etc., could get a little tedious. Scenarios with 4 or 5 monster types were often a drag. Playing the game on tabletop simulator (which can automate some of this stuff) does help a lot here.   --It is almost always better to avoid monster attacks--dancing out of their range, putting obstacles between them and you, stunning and disarming them, or simply hitting hard enough to kill them--rather than charging in and exchanging blows. The monsters just hit too hard, so any strategy that permits the monsters to hit you a lot is unlikely to work. That was my experience even playing as what is probably the tankiest class in the game. That's fair enough, I guess, but sometimes I wanted to just charge in there, the way a D&D Paladin would. I conformed to the necessities of Gloomhaven, but it would've been nice if it were possible to play as fearlessly as I would have liked.   --There are a few rules I was unhappy with. Most prominently, the implementation of rolling modifiers and advantage is terrible and often made me unhappy to pick up perks, which was a real shame. I strongly recommend house ruling this.  --I think the balancing has some issues. Some of the unlocked classes clearly outshine some of the starting ones. Lack of balance among individual cards is an issue, too. Leveling up and picking between two cards should be compelling, and sometimes it is, but too often one card is obviously superior to the other. The items are perhaps the least balanced of all. Stamina potions are so powerful that literally every character wants to buy two. These also exacerbate the problem of individual overpowered cards, since stamina potions allow you to spam your best card over and over again, making gameplay more repetitive, less challenging, and less interesting.  --The retirement system was a great idea in theory. In practice, some of the retirement quests could be really irritating. For example, one of my character's goals involved doing battle in the forest. He had strong personal reasons for doing so. However, I had no way to get him to the forest! There was nothing in the game that provided any hint whatsoever as to how I could unlock forest missions. We eventually unlocked some purely by chance, but it took forever.   --The event system was very poor. The events rarely provided an adequate range of choices, and the outcomes often felt random in any case.   On the whole, an excellent experience, and a game that fully deserves the acclaim it has received. I listed a fair number of complaints, but the massive strengths of this game easily outweigh those.   I won't be purchasing a copy of Gloomhaven for myself due to price and storage concerns. But I will continue to play it on TTS, and I'll jump at any chance I get to play it in person.  I will be bold enough to suggest the following house rules:   1) Each character draws three personal quests and selects two. Both are ongoing at the same time. A character may retire after finishing either one of her personal quests, or after finishing both (it's up to her.)   This solves the problem of personal quests being annoyingly unbalanced and gives you more control over the fate of your character. I would also allow a redraw if your personal quest options don't unlock a new class.  2) If you have advantage, you choose which result to resolve. If you have advantage and rolling modifiers, you draw two full stacks and choose whichever one you want.   Yes, this makes advantage better, and yes, it makes rolling modifiers better. But so what? The current system is unfun. This system would be fun. I would actually be excited to put rolling modifiers in my deck, for one thing. The game's difficulty is modular anyway.   3) Characters may freely exchange loot and items amongst each other.   Again, this makes the game easier. But so what? Like I said, difficulty is modular. Personally, I don't enjoy the competitive aspect of competing for loot. I find it ridiculous that if someone opens a chest and it has an item clearly useful to some other party member, the player who discovered it has to sell it for half price and the other player has to buy it for full price.   Much better and simpler just to allow trading. This makes the game less competitive and more cooperative, which aligns with my personal tastes. It also means you no longer find it annoying to adventure alongside classes that are really good at looting, like the Scoundrel, but are actually excited to play with them!  4) All stamina potions recover one fewer card; stamina potions can never be refreshed.   This is a necessary balance change. These items were so universally good they overshadowed lots of other fun items and generally made the game more repetitive and less interesting. Part of me would prefer to ban stamina potions altogether, but I think that would be too hard on certain classes with low hand sizes. At least this rule would prevent the worst abuses stamina potions can cause.  I would also like to see a couple of other changes. I'd like to remove all instant-kills that aren't losses from the game (instant-kill losses are fine). I'd like to buff healing, tanking, and summoning in some way, so that these strategies are effective even when monsters become very strong. I'd like to do something to ensure that all classes are viable at low player counts. But these are changes too big to be covered by house rule. ", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Mycoman", "rating": "10", "comment": "A phenomenal experience of a dungeon crawler with rich storyline and theme, deep worldbuilding and several possibilities on how to advance your characters. This is one of the very best games I've ever played.  Pros: - Myriads of options and tons of replayability - Beautiful artwork - Rich worldbuilding - Characters development - Playable also as a solo version, which works very good - The game is pretty complex, but very smooth at the same time - Evolving system and storyline are great - You don't have to do the legacy stuff if you don't want it - Random dungeons option = endless replayability outside the main story line - No dice, the \"rolling\" is made off a personal \"roll modifier deck\" which can be upgraded - this is a brilliant idea! - No time limit on the scenarios, however, as you must rest thru the dungeons, you slowly lose cards, which makes some tough choices and makes the game very interesting - one of my favorite features! - A great price for the amount of content you get - one of the best deals I've made on games so far - Space for house rules if you'd prefer them  Cons: - A long setup and tear down time (but you can reduce it significantly by smart component sorting and/or helper apps) - Your first play will take a lot of time to figure out how it works  Verdict?

{"username": "Nathanieldwolf", "rating": "10", "comment": "played TTS mini campaign and that 1% of the whole game blew me away  The following is a reply to the only person who rated it a one without just saying \"balance\"  the text inside the (parentheses) is the 1 star rating minus some of the useless ranting.  read the full version yourself you you want.  not hard to find since this game has so few 1stars  (The over-hyped, ginormous box of disappointment that will appeal to people who need an RPG cheat code. Nothing says \"adventure\" like reading your dungeon master's scenario before ever playing it. With Gloomhaven you will never be surprised by the location of traps, treasure or monster encounters ever again because you will know exactly where they all are before you even start. What a challenge!)  I have also used pnp cards and heroscape terrain to create a proxy board game experience.  Even with this hodgepodge grayscale edition the core play is solid.  Knowing where everything is seemed odd at first but the difficulty of the game shows this has already been taken into account.  Also a simple search for gloomhaven hidden will give you an interactive PDF that blocks out future rooms and event text until you get to that point.  Very well done and worth the download.    (When paying over $100 for a board game, a box this big better be stocked full of miniatures but sadly it is not and you only get them for your characters.)  I too would love minis in the game for everything but as this game is already huge, 250+ minis would give this game a larger footprint then Zombicide black plague.  That is the ENTIRE black plague KS with all the expansion items.  A full mini version would take a room unto itself.  (This nonsense continues with the amateurish looking world map that has areas titled: \"Dagger Forest, Watcher Mountains, Merchant's Bay, Misty Sea, Lingering Swamp, Still River and yes even Serpent's Kiss River.\" Those do not even sound believable for a fantasy setting. It is as if the designer asked some kids in 5th grade to name everything in the game.)  no comment other then it really doesn't bother me  (Speaking of which, nothing says fun and excitement like putting stickers on your game components to play a \"legacy\" game and destroying its ability to be replayed. It must remind players of those oh so cool gold stars they would get in elementary school.)  I did not like the idea of legacy games myself but this one is laughably easy to \"reset\"  simply do not rip up the cards and put enhancements on the sleeves of a card.  a simple sheet of paper can keep track of the parties position on the world map.  Yes after approx. 400 hours of game I might need to print a new enhancement sticker sheet,  but I will burn that bridge 400 hour from now.  (I've seen reviews falsely calling this \"D&D in a box\" which is a disingenuous, it is not possible for any board game to be compared to an RPG when you lack fundamental character creation. Most dungeon crawl board games are devolved, uninspired RPGs that rip out what made them unique and leave in a pre-made, scripted and poorly designed shell.)  Is this D&D in a box?  As a 20 year DM I can say not even close.  Is it the best campaign style dungeon crawler I have ever come across?  Yes even with only 3% of a hacked version the answer is yes.  certainly the best full co-op one on the market.  (Gloomhaven is much worse than a traditional RPG and most other dungeon crawl board games since it allows you to effectively cheat by knowing the entire layout of a scenario ahead of time. This includes every location you will move into, where all the treasure is located, where all the traps are located and where all the enemies are located that you will be fighting. What is the point of a trap if you know where it is? Having an unfair advantage like this should appeal to people who are poor tacticians yet falsely believe themselves to be \"tactical geniuses\" and maybe that is why people are raving about this game.)  Try it.  Cannot tell you how many times your carefully laid plans were messed up when an enemy draws an 8 initiative when we were all expecting mid 50s like the rest of its deck.   (Thinking a game mechanic is \"clever\" has nothing to do with tactics and nothing about the laughable two card combat system is tactical let alone clever. Using the top and bottom portions of two cards in combat is a handicapping, nonsensical mechanic that stands as one of the worst combat systems I have ever seen implemented in a board game. There is no logical reason why running would prevent me from backstabbing someone on a later turn simply because it was on the same card that has already been used. All this does is add a worthless puzzle mechanic to combat.)  Yes, yes it is a puzzle.  An amazing unique approach to tactical combat. This is kind of the whole point of the combat side of the missions.  If this is a problem for you then you do not want this game.  (While the attack modifier deck is just a lame excuse not to use dice with modifiers that is prone to abuse by failing to properly randomize it due to poor shuffling.)  The customization ability of this deck may well see the end of the d20.  once you understand it elegance the adaptions for it make D&D 3.5 stacking modifiers seem silly.  Again 20year DM and HUGE gaming enthusiast admitting this here.  I love my dice but wow!  this deck concept may be the future.  (Then we have the character classes where most are not in the least bit original but merely synonyms of standard classes with race prefixes (Brute = Fighter, Scoundrel = Thief, Spellweaver = Mage etc...) Don't fear though, as you can later unlock exciting new classes like the \"Human Sawbone\" - I cannot make this stuff up.)  again names don't bother me.  However; the game play of each hero does not hold to any stereotype whatsoever.  all heroes are a blend of at least two main archetypes and each one is a unique and inviting challenge to master and then customize   (Implementing the absolutely worst idea in the history of board gaming, Gloomhaven has people (owners of the game) talking about \"leveling up\" characters via solo play and then bringing them buffed up to their co-op sessions. Really? Who was the referee to make sure they either actually did what they said, did not cheat, took liberties with the rules or even just innocently played certain rules wrong? You mean to tell me if someone who just spent many hours leveling up a character on their own time gets that character killed and with no one around to see are not going to give themselves a \"do-over\"? Who is to stop someone from just declaring the characters are so without doing anything at all? Oh my friends you do not know human nature.)  and here is a prime example of unfiltered rant.  ignore everything in the above section as non of it is true or relevant to this game.  (For over $100 and a box the size of a microwave oven you get to fight against a bunch of cardboard standees while you struggle to keep track of your hit points with a micro-wood counter that either constantly falls out of place or does not fit.)  cardboard standees vs minis: see above wood counters:  first valid point I have seen in this post, and already fixed in the reprint.  (Speaking of bad game design, when you get a big box you get everything BIG! Including the oversized '70s era plastic stands for the cardboard standees that obscure a third of the artwork and give the game an aura of dollar store quality.)  Also true but not really any effect on game play.  (But hey, you did get that BIG box right? Only a game like \"Gloomhaven\" can have a box so big yet be so poorly designed that you cannot fit everything back into it without taking a Japanese origami course.)  and yet you want another 250+ pieces?  Im sorry are you upset that the game is too big or not big enough?   Final review.  STILL A TEN and that's with proxy components to boot.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "tsothoga", "rating": "10", "comment": "At first glance, Gloomhaven looks like another guys-on-a-grid combat game, but look deeper! The tactical combat is a fantastic balance of strategy and desperation, in which you choose to combine two actions from a constantly dwindling pool of cards. And this is a legacy game, so the characters that you level up and learn to love will someday choose to retire, forcing you to unlock and learn a whole new class.

{"username": "sonatajessica", "rating": "10", "comment": "It plays a lot like a D&D game, unsurprisingly. But for me since I am not a fan of role playing a version that has more rules and structure makes the experience more enjoyable. Learning the rules is overwhelming (just as with plethora of components) there is a lot to take and going with that halfway through the 1st scenario we realized there were a few things we were playing wrong. But the actual game play is not that complicated.  I quite like the cards and how you need to choose between top and bottom action and how with resting (which you need to do) your deck gets smaller: choices and strain make every game better.  Still, I will surely need to see after a few more scenarios how I feel. I played the Vermling and like him but am a bit sad that the with the nature of the game and you improving a character you will want to play with the same character instead of trying different ones. Rating will be adjusted over time, for now a solid 7 that could go either way.  Update: Played a second character (spellweaver) twice and vermling twice and I am getting more and more into the game. The devil in the details sometimes still confuses and frustrates me but overall the game is really growing on me. I like it so much more than D&D, what a bit more structure can do to my enjoyment of this type of game :-)", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Corsairs", "rating": "10", "comment": "\"Gloomhaven\" makes me wish my job was playing \"Gloomhaven.\" Other dungeon crawlers lean heavily on dice rolls, and that luck element that can make the experience frustrating at times. But here, it's all on you, baby. No dice - just your keen wits, planning, and card selection between you and death. It's exquisite.  \"Gloomhaven\" is also a highly social game. Sessions invariably come chock full of laughter, groans, cheers, and high fives as players congratulate/curse on another on their wit/ingenuity/greediness. So \"Gloomhaven\" is the best of both worlds. It's a game that makes you think AND feel. That's pretty much the definition of a \"10\" game, in my book.

{"username": "Hawk", "rating": "10", "comment": "Probably one of the best DM-less dungeon crawler / campaign system out there.  The card / exhaustion mechanic works great, as you cannot linger too long and must forge ahead.  If you run out of hit points or cards, your character becomes \"exhausted\" and can no longer participate in the current scenario.  But, your character does not \"die\".  He/she will be able to return, even replay this scenario.  Further, no XP is lost, and you will still gain the XP you accumulated during the scenario in which you became exhausted.  This is the euro friendly side of the game.  There is cooperation, but it is limited in that you cannot freely communicate what you will do or what initiative you will play (1 to 99).  Each turn you will play two cards, one of which will also be used for your initiative.  The init system adds angst to the card selection process, as you may want to play early to get out of Dodge or heal an ally within range, or play later to see what everyone else will do.  Each card you play has a basic attack of 2 and move of 2, plus a specialized attack and move.  Of the two cards you initially selected, you will play the top (attack) from one and the bottom (move) of the 2nd.  Some cards have an attack both on the top and bottom, so these add flexibility to your turn, as you could have a double attack if you don't need to move.  The choice are simply awesome, as you have to guess what and when your allies will act, and try to coordinate.  \"I'll be attacking monster #4 and will play in the middle of the turn\".  What about combos?  Absolutely!  You may play a card which will imbue and element, which you will then be able to use on your next turn to augment your attack/move/buff (unless someone uses is before you!).  Deck building?  Actually, hand-building, as you will have to choose 2 cards from your hand every turn.  But your hand size never changes between scenario.  Since you become exhausted if you run out of cards, you may not want to have nothing but single use strong attack cards, but rather a mix of cards which you can recycle (after taking a short or long rest, you loose 1 card and the rest return to your hand).  You need to build your \"hand\" of cards before the start of each scenario, from a \"pool\" of cards.  When you level up, you will be adding another card into this \"pool\".  Again, your hand size will not change (from what I have seen to date).  There are no dice, but you have an \"attack\" deck of 20 cards, which is essentially a d20.  Cards include +1, +2, 0, -1, -2 as well as a x2 and a fumble (the last two force you to reshuffle your attack deck).  Advantage and disadvantage are covered and work just like D&D (or other adventure type games).  You will also be getting check marks for successfully completing mini in-scenario tasks, which adds extra angst.  After 3 check marks, you get a \"perk\", which will allow you to modify your attack deck.  That's right, the d20 can be modified, essentially giving you a +1 here or there, removing -1, adding effects (wound, stun, immobilize, poison, disarm) as well as imbue the environment with an element, which allows allies and monsters to augment their attack, etc.  Very, very nice!  Did I mention there is no DM?  The monsters have an 8 card AI deck, which indicates what the monsters will do on their turn, complete with initiative number, move, attack, etc.  The \"rules of engagement\" for the monsters can be tricky at first, and may require you read it a few times.  Essentially, for those On-line gamers, the monsters have an aggro range, else they won't move.  Very, very important in some scenarios where you want to avoid engaging the monsters, or by-pass a part of the board.  All the above does not really add too much time to the game, as you should be able to play a scenario in about 3 hours after a few plays.  For us, the sweet spot was 3 players, but a 4th will probably add an additional 20-30 minutes, depending on how quickly he/she plays.  The campaign system is fairly straight forward, and some scenarios are linked and/or have prerequisites.  There are Road (travelling) and City events, which add a bit of role playing (will you select an evil option, or play the good Samaritan?)  Leveling up will only occur after you have completed a few scenarios.  There are 17 characters in the box, and you start with a selection of 6.  The rest are revealed when a character retires, completes his personal mission as well as during the campaign or scenario.  This is the \"legacy\" part of the game/system.  The game may appear pricey, but for what you get in the box, and the quality of the components, not to mention awesome game play, it is well worth it !!  Highly recommended.  Initially rated a 9, but raising to a 10 as it is an outstanding game!  If I was to own only 10 games, this would easily be one of them!  NOTE: I am not an adventure game player, as I actually prefer wargames, but this one just hits the right cords for me, and the tactical choices are excellent!", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Borishko", "rating": "10", "comment": "Incredible game! the production is just perfect, the components great. LOTS OF CONTENT! It's like a RPG videogame experience on boardgame (but a really good rpg). Simply the best dungeon crawler i ever played.  However to be fair, there are a couple of cons: First, the game is a bit complex, the rules are extensive (but the manual is really good written), took a while to remember all the situations and the exceptions. Can be a bit overwhelming to new players, in fact the first explanation took us about 2 and a half hours. Second, the game is quite difficult. It's a tactical game, that encourages you to not do metagame talk, to roleplay your character (i find that awesome), and this make things more enjoyable but makes the game more difficult (a lot more difficult). You will need several scenarios to get the class you picked, to know the cards and the synergy of your character. Third, the random element can be frustrating on early game when you haven't upgraded your modifiers decks jet. There are no dice, and you can somewhat calculate the chances on what are you going to draw, but sometimes random is random and bad random, and you miss or die. But the game is fair, you need to learn to anticipate and administrate better your actions.   ", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

My roommate and I tried to make our girlfriends play D&D, but the RPG side of it didn't appeal to them. We're all big fan of legacy games, and so we thought this could maybe work with them. We're only a game in, and I'm pretty impressed by the balancing of the mechanic. It definitely feels like D&D, without the RPG and world-inventing (that I LOVE), but with a more streamlined mechanic that help us go smoothly through all the excitement of an exploration adventure.  Update: 62 games in. We're addicted! We've unlocked every classes and we're crawling into all the different side quests instead of resolving the main quest as we don't ever want it to end.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The depth of it is what really makes it shine, as there are AT LEAST 50 scenarios you will play with a maximum of 100+ if you go with everything that was officially designed for the game. That puts the value at $1 per play which is unbelievable.   This game will take you over a year to play out. You will want some breaks, and that's a good thing. I've painted mini's to help with the fatigue at times. The component quality is OK, but the mini quality is sub-par. Don't buy if you just want the mini's. However, there is a ton of cardboard here and the value is the best in the industry.   This is my #1 game of all time and it's frankly not close.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The core mechanics are brilliant. The way it works with the card selection and how you're exhausted when you run out of cards works really well.  The feeling when playing Gloomhaven can be compared to the old Baldur's Gate PC games and I've enjoyed every moment when playing Gloomhaven.  The monsters you encounter feel unique and thematic. Small spoiler but there's bosses in this game and they all feel unique and have different mechanics.   The different characters are also very unique and play completely different.   Gloomhaven is expensive but for the amount of content and play time it's worth it.  This is the best co-op dungeon crawler I've played so far and the so far the whole experience is brilliantly designed.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Big thanks to Isaac Childres and the team for making this game. I would gladly be kickstarting a sequel if it was ever made. Some things that can still be improved:  -Monster skill decks should evolve for high level monsters so that not only their hp increases but also the way they act in the field. -Better AI rules for monsters. It doesn't hurt to make it more complicated. Hey come on, we're all +5 here aren't we? Conditional cards on monster decks could make it more challenging. Also, monsters could collectively change their behavior during battle based on Boss monster commands or other triggers on the field,  e.g. if(attack_mode_on) {Move(); Attack();} else if(heal_mode_on) {Retreat(); Heal();}. Sometimes monsters ruin their good start by spending many turns doing essentially nothing. -Campaign could be deeper. There's a huge potential in teaming up with fantasy writers and implementing the game in the Gloomhaven format.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Can't wait to play, open locked content, see new scenarios, level up and unlock skills and play, play, PLAY!  Additionally... this game surprised me in one very interesting way: its a campaign/legacy game where 75% of the content is hidden and locked. When I saw it for the first time, I was like \"I want to quickly retire my characters and open boxes, then retire them and open more!!!\" What I did not expect, was that like 15 scenarios in, with my Brute close to retiring... I did not want to. I liked that character and wanted to continue playing as Inox. That is ... a very pleasing surprise.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Second session we first went to the Barrow Lair and then we all wanted to not to stop (even when the clock was well past a good session ending time) and went to the next scenario. My friends have been impatiently asking me about when will we continue our journey and I feel the same. I have never had this kind of an effect in any of the board games I've played.  I love how balanced it feels. I have played some PnP RPG in the past and I would not compare that to this. It still has some optional similarities, like I love how we the players can flavor the things we do as an action, like we do when we play D&D, Ars Magica etc.  I know I will most likely lower my rating once we've played the game far enough, but at the moment the game is as good as the \"hype\" I had previously seen. To be honest, I did not expect me to like it this much.  Pre rating post: 2nd print all sleeved, Laserox inserted and ready to start playing.

{"username": "UPA941", "rating": "10", "comment": "This game has replaced all of my other dungeon crawl / scenario or campaign type games. I still enjoy games like Citadels and Betrayal for party games, but this game is by far the best campaign game I have ever played. The mechanics are much more streamlined and easier to follow than most campaign games, but also much more intricate and strategy driven. Particularly as a result of the luck mitigation through no dice chucking (the cards are much less swingy).  Something like Descent 2nd edition, or Imperial Assault only lasts around 10 or so scenarios, but this goes on for 100+ scenarios and has legacy mechanics that drive the just one more game mindset. Very fun to play, and my gaming group only wants to play this anymore, which I am always down for. I love the loot, monster, and scenario variation as well. Some scenarios are very unique, giving a feeling of difference on various scenarios. All around, an awesome game. Well done Isaac!", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "matcook", "rating": "10", "comment": "Dont own the game as playing friends copy.  So far really enjoying the game (at least 15 seasions through I think).    One of the problems with coop games can be alpha player syndrom.  Admitedly that comes down to your play group and Im sure some groups would be fine with any game but not others. The way you are only meant to share partial information and each have your own choices to make would hopefully make that not an issue with this coop game.  There is a lot to unlock in the box and enjoying that although being only able to play max of 1 scenario a week sometimes feels like you are not really advancing quick enough. That is allieviated by the different ways each scenario will force you to adapt and when one of the other players advance and you haven't you still may need to change the way you play. The fact equipment, perks and levels all make a difference and may advance seperatly from each other helps keep things moving.  Lots of threads talk about concern over the price and the legacy aspects of the game. To me thats not a concern as if you enjoy the game you will get great value for money with all the content included. I would avoid marking map and cards possibly if you are unsure you will like the game, until you have played a few sessions and should then have a good opportunity to judge.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Sniperdogg", "rating": "10", "comment": "I am pretty tough with my ratings and don't give out a 10 star lightly. Dollar for dollar I have not made a better purchase of a board game.   99% spoiler free review, nothing will ruin any of the surprises or classes. Just enough to give you some insight on how the game works.  What I found in this heavy box was a very deep tactics style RPG with tons of content  (hundreds of hours). It's a lite version of D&D without the need for a DM. I have been playing D&D for over 30 years and have a dozen dungeon crawler board games and this hands down is my favorite.   Story:  There is some nice flavor narrative for each mission as well as an overarching story. It's well written but not as deep as a pen and paper game. I still found it light years beyond the nearest direct competitor. My group has enjoying the events that have happened but I will not disclose any elements of the story in this review.  Characters/Classes: 17 (I have not unlocked them all and will not spoil them) The races are not entirely based on Tolken / mythology like most other games. The classes are also not copies of D&D. I really appreciate the work done to make new fantasy races but still have them familiar enough that you have an idea on how they should act. From what I have seen each is quite unique. They have unique abilities and even the way their \"dice\" decks evolve is different. You start with a choice of 6 and unlock the others through gameplay.  Scenario/Dungeons: 90+ in the box, some additional available free online including a solo scenario for each class. Each scenario represent a normal game session. It's a couple of hours long depending on the number of players. There are branching scenarios so by doing one you might cut off another. This adds somewhat to the replayability. There is also a scenario generator in the game that creates random scenarios. At any time you can just make up new 3 room dungeon that is already balanced.   Town: The town of Gloomhaven levels up separately from the players. It depends on player choices as well as some random events. As the town levels up new items unlocked for purchase. This level also impacts new characters / players as they join the campaign.   Random events: There are cards that make up the random events that happen outside of a scenario. They are both good and bad. It adds some flavor to the world much in the same way random encounters work in D&D.   Final comments: I am by no means a expert on this game. I do not want to spoil it for myself so it will take a long time for me to see everything to make a 100% comprehensive review.  I have played it several times a week with 3 people for two straight months. I feel like that was enough time for me to understand the game, see most of enemies and core mechanics to write an honest detailed review.  I really hope that this game gets expansions in the future. I'd love to see a new continents to explore, enemies to fight, and new classes to unlock.  I haven't come close to exhausting the existing content, but the design could easily scale up in the same way that pen and paper RPGs do.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Needless to say, it didn't take much convincing. After one scenario, we were hooked. The meta-game is great, really pulls you into the story, and the scenarios themselves are simply fantastic. The cardplay mechanisms work so well, and the enemy AI is a masterwork of elegant design. Looking forward to seeing more of what this world has to offer.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Milletits", "rating": "10", "comment": "This is the first time I rate a game on BGG. I've got tons of games of all genres but this one deserves my first ten! Luckily I am in a group of other geeks and heavy gamers, who also like RPGs and LARP. We've played now 15 Scenarios and all of theme were interesting and tense, nailbiting thrilling and some of them were won on the edge. This one is really cooperative, together you outline schemes and then you execute them properly, otherwise ... The AI of the bad guys is the best system I have ever seen in such a game. This will be hard to top! So what else to say: the game entertains, is compelling and full of interesting decisions: No dice, a bit of randomness comes through cards you use during fights, but not too much, just enough for some tactical  decision-making. Core Engine of the game is the mechanism of the ability cards, which you play during your turn and which gives every character a really unique way how to play. Well, there are so many more amenities so i really don't know, where to start and where to end. To me this game is the essence of a good game with no flaws at all. Still I recommend to all the gamers, who are looking for a short, light Dungeon Crawler with beer and pretzel feeling: hands off.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Kuroponta", "rating": "10", "comment": "After playing about ten scenarios of Gloomhaven so far, I can say that this is definitely one of my favorite board games of all time. I have always been a fan of dungeon crawlers and this game just does things right. You got noticible character progression with scaling difficulty levels, a lot of different playable characters, most of which need to be unlocked and a huge amount of monsters. Most dungeon crawlers out there have a very limited selection of monsters to fight or require you to buy a load of expansions to get more monsters, because they all come with expensive miniatures, so overall you have to invest a fortune. In Gloomhaven the monsters are cardstock, but that's completely fine with me. I get a lot of different enemies at a reasonable pricetag. What I also like about Gloomhaven is that there is so much stuff to unlock and explore. You get cohesive story arcs that unfold over the course of the game, while there are also some unrelated sidequests to do. The combar system is very fun, as it does not rely as much on the luck of the draw as many of the dicechucking games do. You have to make meaningful decisions, while communicating with your party members and due to the scaling difficulty, in the end it will often be quite close. Overall this game has just been awesome so far and I can't wait for an expansion, even though we're not even half part through it yet.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "jklaiho", "rating": "10", "comment": "Play an individual mission of Gloomhaven without any surrounding context, and the experience does not come close to a ten. You may wonder, what's all the hype about? Play a campaign, however, and the game becomes so much more than the sum of its parts.  Engaging cardplay mechanics combine with an appealing character progression system and a story that unfolds at a satisfying pace as the campaign progresses. Once you get going, you have to see it to the end.  Gloomhaven is an unrivaled experience in the entire field of boardgaming.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "countstex", "rating": "10", "comment": "Despite the \"Best with 3\" rating here, my wife and I enjoy playing this as a 2 player co-op more than anything else we've tried. The balance in the game seems really well implemented, with our success or failure often coming in the last moments of a scenario, and the slower progression make things feel more epic.  We've yet to try having some our friends along for a scenario, but I can see that happening at some point. The ability for others to drop in and out of our campaign is a really cool concept, and fits well with the setup of each character you play being rather self centred.  Our only real complaints at this point are that the constant sliding of standies into the stands it quickly wearing on the card stock, and that you can see the whole layout of the dungeons during setup. Perhaps an implementation were the actually scenarios where on cards like the random dungeons that you only flipped over when you entered each room might have worked well.   But these are very minor things, and no need to give the game anything less than a full 10.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Benyan", "rating": "10", "comment": "2nd Kickstarter printing. Played 15 scenarios so far and it has been excellent. Main cons are setup and repetition of \"kill all\" goals. However, I found the core gameplay to be very enjoyable and the feeling of constant (although slow) progression  keeps me getting back to the game every available weekend since I own it. City and road events help in creating the world and introduction and conclusion sections of each scenario give much more context than for example Imperial Assault did most of the time. Some lifegoals can be a bit of a grind while others unlock scenarios and thereby extend the narrative of the world. Give it a try if you can (and you have time for slow but very satisfying progression).", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Very tight games so far, love the combat! Not sure I would like this as much as I do if the designer went with dice combat. Looking forward to continuing the adventure.

{"username": "Coaldrone", "rating": "10", "comment": "Utterly compelling experience. The basic structure of the game is simple: your characters do stuff around town, then they go and try to complete a quest. Repeat. But what justifies this game's high rating is all the excellent elements that form this structure. The depth, the flavour of the world lore, the different enemies you face, and the different character classes available to play. There is a lot of originality injected into this game, and in the fantasy genre this is often difficult to attain.  This is a game intended to be played across DOZENS of sessions, and each cycle of Town/Scenario lasts at least 3 hours each. With as lofty as premise as this, there is always a danger of becoming jaded and disinterested in the game's mechanics. But Gloomhaven subverts this frenetically, all the time. Impossible to describe due to the game's depth. You just have to believe the hype in this instance.  EDIT: Today I changed my rating of Gloomhaven from a 9 to a 10. It has been five months since we began playing (at least once a fortnight, oftentimes weekly) and it is often the highlight of our working week. We discuss the game constantly even when we're not playing it - if anything, rather than becoming bored and over-familiar with the game, we have just become more obsessed!", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "BentlyCash", "rating": "10", "comment": "I love the story, decisions, lack of steering(mostly), and all other campaign elements.  The mechanics... are fiddly. I'm still in the rulebook, all the time, making sure I got things right. It's really a problem created by Issac's lack of compromising. Had he created a game that started out very simple, then scaled in complexity with expansions, it might have been easier to learn and grasp. But the sheer scale of everything that makes the game so epic is also exhausting for someone entering the world for the first time. We'll see if this changes as we continue to play through.  Update: After 10 plays, it's really starting to grow on us. The rules are starting to cement themselves in, and we're reading the rulebook less and less. Furthermore, we're really enjoying the differences in each scenario. While I don't care much for deck building, it's fun to look at a built map, read the objectives, then choose the optimal abilities for that particular scenario. I appreciate the modifier deck and how there is no dice to roll and screw us over time and time again. Still not sure that it's the best game ever created, but it's become a permanent fixture on the table.  2nd Update: It's made it to a 10. I've had more fun/minute played with other games(mostly mathy euros), but it is just so satisfying to plan and execute each scenario, which somehow all feel different and fresh, even after 15+ plays.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Kenfeldman", "rating": "10", "comment": "Another update after one player retired their first character, with the new character joining as level 3 with rest of the characters at levels 7 - 9.  The new character is a bit weaker than the others, but is still powerful enough to contribute to the party and that player is having fun adapting to the new abilities.  I think retirement is a good mechanic that will enhance replayability and prevent the characters from becoming over-powered as they gain experience.  I now have 10 plays and am really excited about this game.  It scales very well to different numbers of characters and different party levels.  The adventures remain challenging and require some creative problem solving mixed with a lot of spell casting and sword fighting.  It's a great game.  Further update:  I'm impressed with the variety of adventures in the game.  There is a lot of \"kill the monsters\", but not all of them.  The exhaustion mechanic looms over some of the ones with larger/longer rooms that must be accomplished quickly.  All require a lot of discussion among the players about how to accomplish the objective.    Update after four plays in a four-player campaign.  Raised my rating to a 10! Gloomhaven creates the feeling of a challenging role playing game where a successful run through a scenario feels like it's a close call that requires good teamwork.  There's an excellent balance in the power levels in that characters feel powerful enough to do fun stuff during the adventures, but not over-powered.  Levelling up feel like an accomplishment and happens frequently enough so that you don't feel like your grinding away for enough experience points for the sake of leveling up.  Completing the adventures feel like they advance the campaign.  The world itself is very refreshing.  The races aren't your standard elf, halfing, dwarf and orcs/goblins found in so many other fantasy rpgs.  The card management system allows the characters to fight, cast spells, run around gathering treasure enough so that even low level characters can help a party while putting a good limit on individual powers and setting a time limit for the quest.  When you run out of cards, you're done!    Initial rating based on one play in my gaming partner's family campaign.  They had three previous adventures under their belts, so more cards and items.  My starting character (orchid spellseeker?) was quite powerful for a starting character in a fantasy rpg, so although I had to rest to recover cards before they did, I wasn't at a huge disadvantage.  I could still fully participate and have fun.  My impressions are that this is a really good individual fantasy combat system based on cards.  The characters have miniatures and the monsters are cardboard standups.  The world seems pretty well fleshed out and there seem to be competing factions or npcs hoping to hire the player adventurers (the \"shifting motives\" alluded to in the publisher's advertisement for the game).  There are opportunities to level up but characters retire eventually, so they don't get too powerful.  I played with people who had an organizer for the boards, a combination of plano and ziplocks for markers, miniatures and cards, and several apps downloaded onto a tablet, so it went fairly fast.  Otherwise, this would probably be too burdensome to play regularly, as there are so many pieces that it would take a long time to find them when needed.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

That's a really traditional aspect of storytelling.  - Like many said - set up take really long. The game wasn't though out in a way to reduce visual clutter. Just for ability cards you need 5 zones (discard, lost, active, being played and hand). You either need to use some replacement parts (like dice instead of life chits) or get a really big table.  - Tracking choices is hard. And even if you write down what is this scenario should lead to, you can open the scenario book and find out that it is locked by some achievement you haven't heard yet. Map serves a purpose of tracking your campaign progress but after a while you will fail to remember what place is what.  - Rules are well written but still contain many quirks. You can be certain at least some rules. Instead of expanding the FAQ, Isaac could have add some reminder text on cards to help you understand how to use them - the cards are quite big, have no art and usually there is plenty space.   Despite all that the game is really, really good.  - The combat, it's core, is fun and challenging. Choosing what cards to loose for good, predicting how will the enemies move, optimizing your moves with other players - engrossing. - the progress really feels deserved - going forward a single level easily takes 3 or more scenarios and when you do level up it unlocks so much that it makes a difference.  - the scenarios are well thought out. Many times we would win by a hair's breadth and it was so relieving to know we do not have to replay this scenario ( because it take so much time). I actually thought that the game was too hard out of the box - until I've found out I've placed too many monsters for the first scenario for the first two attempts.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "soccastar001", "rating": "10", "comment": "Immediately one of my top 10 games of all time.  I really enjoy dungeon crawlers but haven't found a board game that really gave me anything I don't feel I get better out of either RPGs or video games.  This is the first one I think with the systems that really give that to me.  The premise itself isn't really much different from other similar games like Descent but the way that deck and hand management, enemy management, progression, adventure discovery, etc. work is just all so refined and well done and melds together perfectly.  I can't really explain all the systems in such a small form factor but 'elegant' is the best word to use to describe it.  This game has some minor legacy type features.  You put stickers on a board as you unlock new adventures as well as unlock a few envelopes and \"prestige class\" like character types as your characters progress to a certain point.  The box is gigantic, the biggest I think I've ever had on my shelf but that is because it is chock-full of awesome stuff.  It looks amazing as well with high production values and great artwork.  I really have nothing negative to say about this game.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

BUT if you are in the easy (gateway gamer) to mid (1-1.5 hour game length threshold) level of board game hood, then I don't recommend you get this game just yet. It's on the higher end of finicky and will be hard to stomach straight away. The other downside to this game is that that group of friend you play this game with (the very same group you played all your games with) now JUST want to play Gloomhaven. They are no longer your board game group, they are now your Gloomhaven group, and so have way through the campaign you wonder \"why did I even bother buying other games?\"   So essentially, yes, this is a game that's amazing, that has you talking and thinking about it days after any time you play.

Most of scenarios had \"we lost for sure!\" moment being transferred into \"wow! We did it!!!\". Very satisfying experience. Not sure how Isaac did it, but I never saw such refined balance in other games.  Legacy elements could be deeper, but what we have already is good.  Branching story is definitely plus, even though I don't expect much - this is not PC after all.  Card game mechanic is simple but exciting. Many people tend to complain about restriction of information flow between players. I love it. Without secrecy on \"initiative\", game would transfer into chess. In most cases your perfect plan would be modified by teammate in your way, unexpectedly early\\late monster initiative or their non-standard action. Cards lost mechanic is good way how to apply timer. We know much worse ways (like Encounters in DnD board games). This mechanic not only rush you to fulfill the goal, but force you to prioritize your powerful but \"lost\" and weaker but \"discarded\" cards.  Last but definitely not least. Upgrades. Hands down - awesome. You can control your luck to certain extend by modifying Attack Deck. It not only adds some damage to your attacks, but adds additional helpful perks. You can not only damage enemy, but add \"poison\", \"wound\" e.t.c. to it. Or maybe push/pull them.  After completing certain mission, you could upgrade cards themselves. This is costly, but interesting, as provides some interesting choices.  Next level gives you better cards, that you can add to your hand. Mind you, that you can choose which of them to take to mission, based on possible enemies. More AOE? Or concentrate on single target damage? Or maybe more buff/healing for party?  So why I keep 10 as my rating?  Game is huge for it's price point. 90 scenarios + random ones, many enemies, legacy elements and dissent story, funny way of upgrading/manipulating your hero and his abilities,.........    P.S. September 7, 2018.  This game is my #1. After many, many plays with other group, solo and with wife, I keep score the same - 10! Amazing game! ", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

At this thing point I have 69 plays about 2+ hours each. On game night with the app we were able to get two missions done a week, not bad. Some people can go faster, but we like to optimize. So it takes fewer turns to win, but the time is longer. Not sure if we're doing it right in that way... We're on a break playing other games right now but we're planning on coming back to the 10 mission campaigns Issac put out. The dual action card system is awesome. It is well deserving of all the love and awards it has.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Brtlblayk", "rating": "10", "comment": "Gloomhaven is a beast of a game. Most co-op games are like puzzles that end up having one person in a group dictating what each players moves are. Gloomhaven erases this concept with the help of your personal cards and what you as a player plays. Every class is different and you must learn who you are to maximize the best outcome for your team. Sometimes that changes depending on what scenerio goal you pull, and your team mates might not exactly know what your plan is. You really do feel like you\u2019re playing a video game. You really become attatched to your characters and your character really does have a personality based around a background you create and the cards you have. I highly recommend this game for anybody that likes fantasy and dungeon crawlers. Playing solo, however is not the best way to play this game. The challenge is the other people at the table. The puzzle is wondering what they will do, and when you go in a round that can completely change the plan you initially had. Top marks. This game will be played quite often.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

This game is spectacular - but you likely already know this from the buzz and all the other reviews.  So let's talk about what's kind funky about it.  The rules aren't always as clear as they could be and there's some FAQs out there, but sometimes you just have to go with it.  And it can be kinda fiddly.  And even with an organizer it takes up a ton of space and has a fairly hefty set up and tear down time.  It's also fairly slow paced and very much a puzzle as opposed to a standard dungeon crawl - which is very unique and interesting but won't be for everyone.  The legacy aspects are fascination since it's more about how the world shapes up than your specific characters and party.  It feels very well done.  Something I haven't seen a lot of people talk about is the narrative.  I find myself looking forward to every city event and dreading every road event.  The writing in the scenarios is solid (though not always amazing) and occasionally gets a bit disjointed as you skip from scenario to scenario but the stories that organically grow are quite fun.  I won't share the personal narrative of my band of misfits here for the sake of spoilers, but I do plan to compile it at some point.  So overall - it's a very good, very unique game, that feels like it's for a niche audience but has also seemed to have broken out somehow.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

One of the things I like best about the game is that there is little to no downtime between rounds.  The reason is you are always looking for the next best combo for what you want to accomplish and you are always engaged in the game.  So far, one of my all time favorite games!  I can't wait to get my hands on the 2nd edition of Gloomhaven.  I will circle back to my rating once I get the game and start playing...

{"username": "lrmhorner", "rating": "10", "comment": "Played about 15 scenarios so far, experiencing 6 character classes (2 players, each of us controlling 2 characters, 2 retirements so far). It took about two scenarios to get the hang of the mechanics; especially your hand of cards being the scenario timer, how you avoid getting killed (exhausted), and how you perform actions, but it also took a short while for the enemy AI to become intuitive. But, here i am, and i can say with confidence this is an incredible game, easily in the top five i've ever played. I'm a huge fan of Mage Knight board game because of its ingenious complexity, mechanics, and puzzle-like take on RPGs. I'm also a fan of Descent 2ed because of how fun it is to play with a group of people and scratches the classic dungeon crawler fix with typical Fantasy Flight quality and quantity of expansions. To me, Gloomhaven is almost the ideal combination of Mage Knight and Descent 2ed.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Not for everyone but certainly a masterpiece and mightily ambitious game that deserves attention.  UPDATE Ok I'm really digging this game, it is something I didn't do in a long time. I really would like to play this game even with all its faults I keep going back. Best bang for you buck ever. I hope they'll Kickstart a third printing.

I can't think of another board game that I have played this much, ever, and it's rivaling many of the RPG campaigns I've played in for longevity at this point.  We are just about to play the scenario that will unlock the expansion that I got a few months ago.  I'm on my 3rd character, but I'm the laggard in that regards for our group (I think everyone else is on their 4th or 5th character).", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

I feel like I just wasted a few hours and I have to replay the scenario again.  I want this game to be fun to play over it to be more challenging, so I played this game with a house rule, all perks unlocked from the start.  Happy hunting.

In all, before reviewing, played the game 7 times with groups, and 5 times solo.  Dec 18 - Rated the game a 10. Every time I sit down to play this thing I feel like I am transported into the world. (same a watching a great movie).   There are people complaining that the 10s are coming out as some sort of an of balance agenda. I think most of the tens, just could be, due to the fact that this game is born from extremely brilliant hard work.  The Pros for me.  \u2022\u00a0The Alpha gamer is dead here. Gloomhaven most brilliantly takes care of the MAJOR issue I have with most legacy games. That being, no one person can 'play' for everyone at the table. THANK YOU Isaac. I got sick of this with 'Pandemic' games almost immediately.  \u2022\u00a0There is a TON of game here for the price. I am shocked that this game was priced around $100. It could have been broken out into 10 different expansions and cost a whole heck-of-a lot more.   \u2022 This turn mechanic is fantastic for dungeon crawling. It adds suspense, humor, real team work, and strategy for every turn played.  \u2022\u00a0Upgrading my character becomes a heavily desired achievement! I find myself not looking ahead at my characters future powers because the anticipation for reaching these points is a real desire. (not sure how I am going to feel about retiring one yet, have not reached this point).  \u2022\u00a0The MOST fun I have had playing a dungeon crawl with a group of equally interested players.  The Cons for me.  \u2022 The set up can be a beating. Especially solo play.  \u2022 You need a long stretch of time to really get into this game. This can be tough if you are a parent (like my entire group - but we have creatively come up with a solution that fits all, so actually wouldn't that be a good thing?).    I love the game. If there are balancing issues, I have yet to run into anything that ruins the game. I can't imagine a game of this scope not having a few issues like that from time to time, but we have just tossed out those issues (which are very few) with \"well real-life isn't fair either\".  AMAZING game Isaac!! Grats on reaching number 1 - VERY well deserved.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The world, the scenarios/missions, the decision-making, the characters and abilities, the enemies, the maps, the leveling-up, a thousand other things, and last but not least, the BEST combat system I have ever had the joy of playing.   The card based combat is better than any dice-rolling or any other card combat I have ever played. Before I played this game for myself, my friend tried to explain why it was so good, and it didn't sound that special to me. But then I started playing the game for myself and I instantly understood what he was talking about. Like him, I could try to explain to you how fun and balanced the cards are, how you use the top half of one card and the bottom half of another on each turn. I could explain how these cards are also like your health (in addition to your actual health), and how fun and challenging it is to use the right ones at the right time. I could also talk about how amazingly all the character's and enemies abilities come together. But even after all that, you'd probably be like me and not think that this game is anything special. So if that's the case, I would strongly encourage you to simply believe the 9.1 (current) rating and go play the best game I have ever played.

{"username": "jrupes", "rating": "10", "comment": "Is it perfect - nope. But I honestly didn't think board games could get to the point where they have you craving more similar to a great video game RPG or similar. Only this and Pandemic Legacy have done that for me thus far. I'll admit that interest has waned somewhat even though I'm only ~10 scenarios in... meaning the game won't last forever (expecting to get to ~20 plays before moving on).", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

There has not been a game that I have won easily. All came in very close. This is Euro mechanics meets dungeon crawler.  Euros are usually quite bland in terms of theme but this game is soaked with it. The stories are very well written and often hilarious dialogue. The events are even better and my gaming partner have gotten a lot of good laughs from it.  It is amazing how one designer can pull all this off. The characters are also so different in terms of how they play. Highly recommended and I suspect it will only climb up my top 10 with each play.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "daivz", "rating": "10", "comment": "I think I'm mostly writing this review as a counter to all of the spiteful people who have given this game 1-star as \"balance\" to the Kickstarter fanboys.  Gloomhaven is anything but a 1-star game.  If you are looking for the unlimited flexibility that a pen and paper RPG offers: Gloomhaven is not what you are looking for, nor does it claim to be such. What it claims to be, and what it delivers, is a 2-4 player co-op, dungeon-crawling campaign that is card-based instead of dice-based. This campaign will also take you about 18 months to complete if you can get together only once per week with your group--as my group does.  Gloomhaven is a RPG lite. You don't get to increase your strength or endurance; you never get a bigger card hand than each class initially starts with; you can't try to reason with any of the monsters you encounter in the scenarios. You do get to augment your attack modifier deck to eliminate bad randomness; you do get new abilities (cards) and can switch your build from scenario to scenario; and you get a huge world with lore already fleshed out to explore and choices to make in that world. To me, the difference between the pen and paper RPGs and RPG lites is you write the story in the former and you read the story in the latter. Maybe you and your group are amazing storytellers: I am not. But, at the point my group is at in Gloomhaven, it feels like we're leaving the Shire, or Winterfell, or the Two Rivers (or whomever you think is a great fantasy author or whatever you think is a great series/story) and we have no idea how it is going to end, but it feels like it will be, for lack of a better, trite, and overused word, epic.  It's easy to cherry pick the comments of people who min-max in games, using them as overarching examples of how the system of Gloomhaven is flawed, bringing overpowered characters that have been solo-leveled when no one else is around, assigning clandestine motives and other insidious sweeping generalizations on those who have rated this game so highly. These people are present in every game: they look up the best strategies, have little regard for spoilers, and seek to exploit game mechanics in order to win or do the best. Gloomhaven is not chess. The players are not pitted against other players, but, rather, against a set system. It is a puzzle. Once your party's and monsters' initiatives are revealed, every player can figure out exactly what the enemy is going to do and when. Variance is introduced by the attack modifier decks, but, anyone can generally know exactly who will be attacked by what and for how much damage.  The personal quest cards, battle goal cards, city and road events, etc. all add flavor and lore to make it so the characters and methods of play vary from scenario to scenario. I probably would have never created an extraordinarily greedy healer-type character who runs through a dungeon opening doors, creating undue stress on the group because now we have multiple rooms' worth of monsters to fight, but those were the cards I drew and it was entertaining playing a completely different way and still barely coming out of the dungeon victorious.  To sum this up: tic-tac-toe and the card game War are one-star games. Gloomhaven isn't perfect; I don't know of a game that is, Perhaps the \"fanboys\" claim it is, I don't know. Pandemic: Legacy, in my opinion, shouldn't crack the top 50. (Nor the top 100, even) I highly dislike and do not enjoy playing it. Is it a 1? Of course not, but I'm not so petty to rate it as such to bring down its rating even though I personally think its rating is entirely too high. Gloomhaven, though, is an outstanding game that I will enjoy playing for the foreseeable future and, as such, according to BGG's rating system, Gloomhaven, for me and my gaming group, is a 10.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

While I'm scoring at at 10, I'm doing that realizing fully that it's not a perfect game. A few of the mechanics feel arbitrary (after we kill all the bad guys, we can't loot the bodies?), and it plays a bit slower than it could.  It earns the 10, though, for the sheer quality of the experience. I started as Cragheart, and I can't wait to play a bunch more sessions with this character to learn it and develop it further, but I also can't wait to bust into those other boxes. The fights with the enemies are really tense, because you're never really sure what they will do--and even in the first scenario, a few enemies did things we weren't expecting at all.  The choices so far feel impressive, and it's amazing how quickly it starts feeling like your own special copy of the game. It seems to play really well with two players, and while I'd be willing to go to 3, I worry that 4 would require a level of tactical control that I know I don't have.  I don't really have much to say that hasn't been said a bunch of times already, but Gloomhaven is a hell of a game, and manages to feel like an OSR dungeon crawl while replicating (pretty much) none of its core mechanics, which is awesome.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

But, considering the description for 10s that I ALWAYS enjoy playing and always want to play, this seemed the most appropriate.  We have a core group of people who play this together campaign-style and we love it. It's a four-hour time investment usually, but we enjoy it every time and always look forward to it. Once you've learned out it works, it runs pretty smoothly and has good components. I recommend downloading a Gloomhaven turn management app to keep track of monsters as it is way easier to keep track of.  The classes are well designed, drastically different from one another, and the game is balanced in such a way that you play them long enough to get a good feel for them, but then are able to move on before you get bored.  Gloomhaven is expensive, no doubt about it, but the cost is worth it. We have sunk dozens of hours into it and I feel like we have barely scratched the surface of the content. If you have a regular group of friends who are relatively advanced gamers, this is a fantastic addition to your shelf.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Inconmon", "rating": "10", "comment": "Incredible design. A true 10 star game and well deserving the #1.  First I don't care much about the legacy elements or the story parts, but it's a great way of slowly unlocking content. It means new players have a limited amount of characters that are easier to learn while more complex ones become available later. Also the starting level of new characters increases over time, meaning even the first character you played will have new options later on that increase or change the experience when playing the character again. Where this design choice really shows is the personal mission each character has. If your character fulfills his secret mission he retires, unlocking new content. This gives you a very specific goal you are trying to fulfill beyond completing the scenario in front of you, and adds so much to the feeling of the game.  What makes Gloomhaven so great is how ridiculously well designed it is. The difficulty is well balanced so that each map is finished just about in time before you run out of actions - and balance is great for different player counts as well. The characters are fun to play with combos and cool abilities. They play very different to each other, much more than in other similar games. The card based based combat is awesome. First you don't draw - your cards and available actions are fully controlled by you. All your options are available as the game starts and slowly you lose cards until you are exhausted - its very clever as it adds an aspect of resource management. Your character can burn very bright for few big moves, but you have to rein her/him in to last till the end of the scenario. Next you don't play a card - you play two cards. Each card has 2 possible actions, top and bottom. For one card you have to do the top action, for the other card the bottom action, in any order. Meaning with only 5 cards left you still have more than 20 possible combinations not to mention that cards can be used as a default attack/move action ignoring their text. On top of that you know which of the cards you might get back after this or further turns and which not, meaning you want to plan ahead for future combos. It's a brilliant system that deserves way more credit than it gets.  In contrast to this there is a damage modifier deck adding up to +/-2 to your attack (we're playing variant without miss/crit). It's a good distribution with +0 being very common, +1 or -1 less common and finally +/-2 being rare. While I dislike this (bad luck on most luck based mechanics), you mitigate this over time - permanently. First you don't roll die, you draw from a deck enforcing a certain level of distribution, second as characters level up they change the distribution of the deck removing negative cards adding positive ones. With new characters starting at higher levels you very quickly skew the deck in your favour. To give you an idea - after 3 scenarios I was level 3 with 1 perk, removing 2x -1 cards and adding 4x +1 cards to the deck. I didn't actually count the cards, but I think you start with 20. You can even add powerful bless cards to it for 1 mission by spending some gold.  This level of randomness in a coop game is fun and I wouldn't change it (coming from someone who wouldn't play the game if it had dice rolling for to hit rolls). And if you like games of chance (first go to a casino and don't ruin boardgames, but second..) you can make the deck more \"chancy\" by removing most +0s and adding few stronger cards to it.  Note that I find the rulebook terrible to use. The rules individually are easy to read and comprehend, but there is many of them and the structure of the rulebook is painful, so finding specific information can grind games to a halt.  TLDR summary: Absolute must-play and #1 is very deserved for its brilliant design and perfect execution.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

It scratches my dungeon crawling itch, along with my brain-burning strategy itch and overall theme takes me back to my D&D days.  It irks me that there's so much unlockable stuff!

{"username": "Neo_1", "rating": "10", "comment": "10 plays in now.  Was able to unlock some new items at the market. We are now starting to modify our specific cards as well.  Very cool.  Games are still very tense affairs.  I love peeling back the layers of the onion and discovering new items, enemies, locations, and the story.  Truly a GREAT game!!!  6 plays in so far.  Still a TON of fun.  Many gut wrenching, heartbreaking moments, along with spectacular team and individual heroic successes.  Love the story telling.  Really makes you feel you are on an EPIC adventure.  I'm happy to say that this game has actually LIVED UP TO ALL THE HYPE!!!  Just 1 play, but that is enough for me to know that this game is a 10 for me!!!  I'm also happy that this is the 1 \"legacy\" style game I decided to settle on acquiring.  PROS:  If you are looking for a Thematic Fantasy, fun, exciting, cooperative and smart (plenty of tough decisions to make) game to play.  This is it!!!  Mage Knight is the only other Fantasy themed game that approaches the GENIUS of this game.  But the story telling and amount of scenarios in this game lifts it above Mage Night.  I've never played a game with so many \"fist bumping\" happy event moments (just in our first game).  CONS:  Rules density.  LOTS of rules.  We are talking close to Mage Knight level of rules.  However, they are well written.  Everything is easy to understand (for the most part) and makes sense (for the most part).  HIGHLY recommend rules summary from Alex Florin in BGG files section.  These are a MUST since they include some FAQ updates.  Lots of things to remember, and this concise yet detailed rules summary make it easier to get the rules in the hands of every player.  Speaking of which, this game is probably best at 3.  With 4 there would likely be too much down time between turns, and with fewer than 3 probably more difficult to successfully complete scenarios and a feeling that the scenarios are lacking a bit of something (just my guess).  Outside of that, your first few games will take a while longer, as rules are digested/clarified and players become familiar with their class ability cards.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

I somehow went past both Kickstarters without even HEARING of the game, and when a friend invited me to a 3 person campaign, I said sure on a whim. Best decision I've made involving board games. I ordered my own copy as soon as they became readily available and will be starting a second campaign with another group later this week. Gloomhaven is an incredible experience, just be prepared for the INSANE amount of punch outs, cards, tokens and legacy components. Not a bad thing, but I had to go buy three tackle boxes from Walmart just to hold it all!", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Luckily it's been a big hit with our current party of 4 and we have play sessions of 10+ hours to finish the campaign. Looking forward to all the unlocks and story evolution.

{"username": "lmcschlueter", "rating": "10", "comment": "Absolutely deserves every ounce of hype. This game is just the freaking best. It's never slow, never boring, it draws you in so effortlessly and keeps you wanting more; I don't think I've ever sat down and played only one scenario. Leveling up is rewarding and exciting, but it's just as fun being low level and getting to try a new class. There's enough unlockable material in the box to keep the game fresh for literal years; all the scenarios are thoughtfully designed and uniquely fun.  The price point creates a notable barrier-of-entry, but for what you get in the box, and the amount of content and enjoyment I've gotten out of it, I would say it's worth every cent. If you think you will play it, buy this game.  The only gripe I have is setup time. It takes forever. There are so many moving pieces, decks of cards that need to be shuffled, enemies and room tiles to find, and then to clean it all up and fit it back in the box is a pain.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

As of this writing, we have played (4 of us)about 20 scenarios give or take 1 or 2. The game is punishingly hard and agonizing right down to the end of each scenario. We start each scenario thinking there is no way...then lo and behold on our death beds we manage to pull out victories. We have already uncovered a few secrets and still have quite a few more to go.

The amount of content is pretty amazing.  My only gripe is the chore of managing it all; an insert is basically a must, as are hundreds of sleeves, and even after those it's a beast to manage, set up and put away.

{"username": "atomheartmother", "rating": "10", "comment": "I finished the entire campaign playing solo (three characters) in under 5 months. That is how addicting this game is. The first play was on 1/21 and the last on 6/16. It took a mere 212 hours and 25 minutes to complete over the course of 72 plays (66 scenarios with five losses/repeats and one repeat to complete a life goal).   To be completely honest, that only counted the time between the start of the first round and the end of the last round for any given scenario. If I kept track of the time spent doing in-between scenario stuff (events, shopping, leveling up/creating characters) along with minimal setup/cleanup, it\u2019d be more like 260 hours. Plus the 10 hours it took to punch, sort, study the rules, and reset the game at the end. So, yeah\u2014it\u2019s a good value.   And a good game. A great game. A masterpiece. The best game ever designed. I can\u2019t begin to comprehend the mind that created this delicate monstrosity of a game. Nor can I fathom what it would take for a game to knock this out as the pinnacle of game design. I\u2019ve never played such an utterly captivating game. It sunk its claws in and wouldn\u2019t let up until it was finished.   The mechanics of the game\u2014both in-scenario mechanics and overworld mechanics\u2014are a thing of art. Brilliant. The rich, unique, and varied world created by Isaac is the icing on the cake. I don\u2019t particularly care for high fantasy, but I cared deeply for the world he created and everything in it. I\u2019ll miss it.   Although no game is perfect (I even have a few very minor quibbles with some mechanics that maybe could use some tiny fleshing out), this game is as close as it gets. Thus, the closing is bittersweet. I\u2019ll miss the world, but I\u2019m glad to have a \u201cnormal\u201d life back. And a now empty table that\u2019s been otherwise occupied by this game for the last five months.   This game is so utterly magnificent that I needed to drop the few other games I\u2019ve rated a 10 down to 9.9.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

By the time it arrived for second printing I was wondering if this would really live up to the huge hype, or would it be disappointing as \"only\" a good game.  No - this is the real deal - and it matches/surpasses the hype. I would say this is the boardgame version of X-Com - the classic PC game where you play a tactical match which gives you bonuses on the strategy layer so you can level up your characters and advance and have more interesting tactical matches. Same virtuous circle here - fantastic tactical game, where you gain XP/Coins/whatever to advance the meta-game - which unlocks new items, abilities, characters, and maps to enhance the tactical game.

I could delve into this game for days on end and somehow find myself engaged the whole time. Yes, the set up and tear down time is too long. Yes, it is expensive, and a hulking box that makes you scratch your head and wonder why you aren't simply playing Warcraft online.

{"username": "ewokracoonbreder", "rating": "10", "comment": "I decided to leave my comments as I went along for perspective. I play a decent amount of heavyish games and have played some dnd. My expectations going in was that this would be a quick efficient version of dnd. You'll see, I was quite wrong and this lead to some unpleasant sessions. After finding the right group to play with and understanding that playing a single scenario with setup could take 3 hours, I've warmed up to the game.   To sum up quickly:  Pros: Vast components, thematic depth (tons of stuff), great legacy element, solid integration of deck building in leveling up, great balance of cooperative vs. non-alturistic play, and REPLAYABILITY (holy crap actually).  Cons: Rulebook (I've read a lot of heavy games rulebooks, there is no index, rules sections are poorly labeled and presented in block paragraph form which leads to needing to read an entire paragraph if you're looking for an exception), Set up/storage, in game logistics, and we're probably playing slow mostly to avoid making mistakes but - single scenarios can overstay their welcome by about 30 minutes.   Neutral: Gaming the system. This is a new concept to me but, it is necessary that you take advantage of the system to your benefit. This means doing strange things in battle in order to produce a good result. The monsters also do bizarre things like don't attack enemies in front of them, walk into traps, etc. But, this is part of the game that I'm getting used to.      2/12/2018 - Played for the first time this past weekend and here are some thoughts: -it looks like magic realm. - there's a lot of crap in the box and it was annoying to find things. I'm in the process of organizing the components to make finding monsters and monster stats easier...with a big step of putting the counter in a plano type box with labels for each monster in alphabetical order and putting the stat cards in order also.  - we played a couple things incorrectly but, I had effectively skimmed the rule book and we were all able to pick the basics up by just starting to play. We thought the modifier deck in the class box was what you used...not the standard decks. We also thought a short rest was picking up your discarded cards then randomly discarding one (instead of losing). Both these things made the game waaaay to easy, but we still had a hard time!!!  - this game is addicting. The mechanics were simple and pleasing. As a group things were tense! We had a lot of trouble figuring out what approach to take and has some heated arguments!  - this felt like dnd. The arguments, the game play, everything felt like a session of dnd.  - it's now not surprising that there is such discussion about this game on bgg. For rpgers, this probably seems lame with not enough creative control over what is happening. For straight euro gamers, this is probably too complex with \"not enough interesting choices\" and \"repetitive play\". Both camps are going to war over how popular this thing is without realizing it hits a lot of buttons for people in the middle. For my group who enjoys a mid weight game and an rpg once in a while, this is perfect because nobody has to do any crazy prep! We can just bang out a dungeon or two over an evening.   2/15/2018 - this game is addicting.  - managing the game is veeery similar to dnd. The setup is annoying but will get better as I implement a good storage system.   6/7/2018  Probably final update here. I have had Gloomhaven set up on my extra game room table now for several months and completed the task of finally putting it away. I'm going to leave my rating at 6.5 (it's been getting lower and lower).   This is a cool game. But, it's a freaking beast of a game. It takes a long time to set up and put away. The AI mechanics are more important than you think and seem to be unnecessarily complicated. The rules as a whole are poorly organized and do not have a glossary. The basic mechanics are easy but, the nuances kill you, and the rules don't do a good enough job to highlight important strange rules.   My \"group\" didn't do well with the brutality of defeat, maybe too many years playing dnd on \"story mode\" rather than the actual rules. From the 6-8 scenarios I've played, many take you to the brink. If they don't, you're doing something wrong. The cooperation element is fleeting because it is really complicated to be coordinated correctly as to be efficient. Then add in the battle cards which ask you to look out for yourself...things got hairy for us.   If you've played role playing games, these rules are not intuitive and may annoy you. You cannot revert to common sense (if this were real life it would play out like this....) and if you start going down that thought path, you will not play the game as designed.    The AI rules, man. It could have been, move to attack the player closest to you as best you can. Instead, you get a page and a half of nonsense which basically says the same thing but not really.   I guess I could keep going but for now the game is away and will probably not come out again for a while.   9/15/2018  During this past summer we had a single session that went much better. My buddy is a video game guy and was integral to helping us understand some basic tactics. He loved the game and begged us to play again.   We had quite an epic session on the date above playing two large scenarios for nearly six hours, including what seemed like a come from behind win when after room 1 of three went really bad, then we all went balls to the wall and won the scenario even getting the treasure.   We're all at level 2 or 3 and it feels like we just have way better combos now.   We've decided to play on a regular basis from now on and have two sessions planned out.   Rating moved up to 7.  Rating moving on up to an 8 - 10/30/2018  I have been playing Gloomhaven at least once a week for the last two months. We had a party of three and added another player. We finally retired a character after about 20 sessions and have been able to unlock two new characters.   We regularly argue about what the correct rules are and it's driving me crazy that a game like this has a rule book written like this is a 2 hour euro. It's desperately in need of a war game style rule book with headings and subsections. Oh yeah, index too.   We've been playing the game not really correct for a long time. You really have read the FAQ to make sure you're doing everything right.   Despite this, we're having a blast and we've gotten much better at tracking conditions and hit points.   November 2018  After consistent campaign play with the same group and a little of the community driven scenarios AND a place to continually have the game set up in between sessions, I have been able to discover why this game rules.   I do want to play this all the time and the main thing that stops us is just not having the entire group together.   I still HATE the rule book. No index? No number sections? Important rules imbedded within long paragraphs?   Oh and track your hit points with dice, forget the counters.

The story line is interesting, side quests (more of an additional quest line?) are available to change the pace. My family is enjoying the progression of story and characters, and we look forward to playing on the weekends. I don't think we're 50% through the game...feels like maybe 25%?  Some cons: minis are not the best, but paint up nicely enough. Components are OK, and my copy seems to be free of manufacturing defects described by others. Set up time is significant; I purchased the Broken Token insert which helps.   Still, it is an excellent game experience. I can't wait to get back into Gloomhaven and will probably auto-buy all additional scenarios and expansions. (Did pick up solo scenarios when available on Geek Store.)", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Everything I wanted in a tabletop rpg with it's progressive leveling system, event cards, and a slowly unfolding campaign. More than anything, the way that this game uses cards to somehow represent both your attacks, movement, and health is astounding, and manages to create a game that really makes you think before you move, only to watch you teammates completely ruin your entire game plan. Overall, despite its high price point, gloomhaven is a game I would recommend any hardcore board gamer if they can find the time for this monster of a game.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "GameAllDay", "rating": "10", "comment": "This game has taken over our dining room table and my mind. Great combat mechanics, light role-playing mechanics on par with a video game RPG.  It basically has everything I want from playing D&D included (tactical combat, character progression, story choices) with all the things I'm not interested in removed (like improvising a conversation with my GM). If you're expecting it to be like a pen and paper role-playing experience or don't like tactical combat puzzles you'll be disappointed. I'm looking forward to playing all the scenarios and all classes.  The coop-with-some-competition style is also really great for any game I think. 100% pure cooperative games like Pandemic are boring and lead to one player making all the decisions. Gloomhaven has just a few little competitive things (loot, battle goals), and hidden info that make the game more exciting and challenging. Lots of people who \"don't get it\" and seem to want to be playing D&D think you should be able to share loot and pick up all the loot in a dungeon once a scenario is completed. But that would make looting during a scenario meaningless and just take away a fun choice from the main gameplay (should I rush to complete the scenario or do I have time to loot those coins?)  The only con for me is that I wish the story had more ambiguous choices and less obviously good/evil choices. If the long set-up time (like 15 minutes for us), big size, and all that is a problem for you, then stay away. For me if I'm into a game then the bigger the better :)", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "alicenchainz", "rating": "10", "comment": "A great co-op dungeon crawler with a fantastic combat system and epic campaign, Gloomhaven offers an in depth experience that makes you want to keep coming back and play.   With a co-op style that balances selfish acts and teamwork you will find yourself working with and sometimes against your friends as your progress through the scenarios and fight the bad guys. The  combat system also embodies the selfish and teamwork aspect forcing you to make hard decisions about what cards to use and when to use them.  The leveling and customization in Gloomhaven is full of options but forces you to make hard decisions about how you want to progress. This variety allows for you to be creative in how you craft your characters abilities and strengths. The designers have done a fantastic job of fine tuning the balance such that it never feels like you are overpowered but it also doesn't feel like your underpowered.   The campaign is over 90 scenarios that you will unlock as you move through the game. Each offers unique challenges and can be set at a difficulty that works best for you and your friends. You will also at times face having to choose between two diverging paths that might close off some scenarios, making your decisions more impactful and leading to some hot debate with your friends about what direction you want to go in.  The game does require a good amount of patience as the rule book is not so well laid out. There are a myriad of small details that can have a large impact on combat and the game in general that missing them can have a negative effect on your gaming experience. I highly recommend watching instruction videos and taking your time when playing the first scenario so as to not miss out on all the important rules.  The set up time is also very long, making the overall game time longer than the 30-120 minutes. The box the game comes in is very sparse on organization so it is up to you on how you want to organize it. For cheep sake, I recommend sandwich bags or card slot holders as your do NOT want to just through the game into the box.  Gloomhaven is the first boardgame for me that has brought back the same level of excitement and adventure that I felt when I first started playing World of Warcraft. Exploring the world without knowing the outcome, spending countless hours connecting with my character and facing the frustration and gratification of epic combat makes Gloomhavenand epic addition to any boardgamers collection. I highly recommend it.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Right now it sits as the best board game of all time and as the best board game I've ever played.  Overtime, maybe that will change.  But right now my gaming group gets together more than we ever have, to play this game.  When we are not playing Gloomhaven, we are talking about Gloomhaven.  When we are not talking about Gloomhaven we are thinking about Gloomhaven.  It really is quite a lot to digest for new players.  The rules are extensive (but the rule book is very easy to read). Even though it is expensive, the Broken Token organizer makes set up and take down so much more streamlined; and for a game we play as often as this, the organizer is totally worth the $80 price tag.  I just feel bad for all the other great board games that we own, now doomed to sit on a shelf and wait to be played again on the day we are sick of playing Gloomhaven.

{"username": "Elite4Xavier", "rating": "10", "comment": "I am 4 plays and 3 scenarios into this game playing solo. It is an excellent game and has been lots of fun. I am not typically a fan of solo games but the puzzle aspects and the theming are phenomenal. I hope to play it with friends soon and am assuming after I have an understanding of the multiplayer gameplay, which I expect will also be great, I will likely be increasing my current rating. EDIT: After my first playthrough with friends, I was entirely blown away by this game. The game was fun on solo play but with cooperative play it is a far more enjoyable experience. There is greater strategic depth and the planning and discussion aspect being cooperative and verbal is far more enjoyable. I'm not planning to return to solo play at least for now simply because the cooperative experience was so excellent.  EDIT: I am increasing my rating to 10. I dont believe that any game is perfect but after 20+ playthroughs I can say with certainty that this game is excellent. Also, everyone here who rates 1 without playing is a blight on this website and I will offset your \"offset ratings\"", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "nikolaskar", "rating": "10", "comment": "+ IMHO for now it is a best light tabletop RPG/dungeon crawl with primary focus on combat that meets tight mechanisms of Euro games  + no dungeon master is required + with a good organisation of components scenarios are quite fast to prepare and play (at least with 2 players) + tight cooperation among the players + huge variety of tactical options during combat due to the card system where all is available from the beginning + attack modifiers instead of dice that can be improved for each character individually + just a right amount of luck, especially with optional rule, that replaces misses with -2s and 2x with +2 + gives a huge bang for the buck in terms of content in the box - from other game publishers for this amount of content you would have to add 2-3 additional expansions + evolving world of the game - new locations, items, characters and secret envelopes are opened once in a while  - low variety of map tiles in terms of graphic design, you have basically majority of terrain as brownish, then you have bluish and greenish:) I think this will be fixed with an expansion - the game is a colossus so requires a lot of dedication in terms of time, preparation and in best case a stable game group is needed - you really need to organize all the components to reduce the preparation time - a bit fiddly mechanic of elements infusion - sometimes we forget to move them...", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

We've really enjoyed games like Descent and Arcadia Quest before, but we really like Gloomhaven. Even my wife is excited about playing this and she's never really liked combat games before.  Unboxing the characters, discovering what the monsters do, finding new items, levelling up and getting new cards, there's just so much we like about this. But I think I enjoy the combat with the cards the most. I love hand management stuff. I like it that all of the cards to different things and you have to think about what cards you want to use together and what cards you want to save for later and what card has the number you want to use for initiative.  I also like it that it is cooperative, but still feels like we're playing against bad guys. I don't really get that feeling with other cooperative games. In Descent, I normally have to play the bad guys and it's not as fun. We love Arcadia Quest, but playing cooperatively in Gloomhaven is a big plus for our family.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "CerealSpnc", "rating": "10", "comment": "KICKSTARTED Excellent Game, Excellent Experience.  Gloomhaven is always a nail biter to the very end of each campaign with less and less cards at your disposal due to the fact of said cards being played and \"lost\" or, characters resting and cards \"lost\" or, cards \"lost\" to prevent damage just dealt to your character.  This game is a balance of decision making with the City and Road cards impacting the start of many scenarios in turn affecting hand/card management as well as movement management.  Gloomhaven will be different for every play group due to the many combinations of starting characters in the party as well as the randomness of the City/Road events. Our group really enjoys the hidden elements to this game as they reveal themselves one card/scenario at a time.  If your group is willing to put the time into this legacy style game and enjoy dungeon crawl style games, this is a definite must have for your group!  WELL DONE Mr. Childres and thank you to Cephalofair Games  for producing this game!", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "ryan890", "rating": "10", "comment": "Lives up to the hype.  Pros:  Card-based decisions (no dice), and constantly faced with tough decisions. Strategy matters. Unique and widely varying characters with an interesting story. Lots of playtime and replayability.  Cons: Long setup/takedown. Mix of minis and cardboard standees. Some things just don't make thematic sense. E.g., in the first scenario we had to make sure we left someone alive while we plundered the room for gold and opened the treasure chest because as soon as the last guy died the scenario would end.  Anyway, that's just to say that there's room for improvement, but after playing two scenarios it seems like a fantastic game.  edit: After completing the game, I changed from a 9 to a 10. While there are many things that could be improved, such as balance and setup time, this game does so much right that it deserves a 10. It's always a good time, even if the lack of balance sometimes makes a scenario's ending anticlimactic.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Having more fun with each play. Can't wait to play it again.  Update after 42 plays: Upped to a 10. We have finished the campaign.

For starters, my wife was not happy about me buying it. The price point, the genre, and the long set-up/tear down time we turn offs for her. Our first game took forever because we had to keep checking the rulebook, and I feared we may end up selling it.  Three weeks later, she is wanting to play it almost every night. We absolutely love everything about the game. Gameplay is fantastic. The characters are so unique, and having an attack deck that is uniquely customizable to each character is awesome. The legacy aspect is wonderful, so wonderful in fact, neither one of us really want to retire our characters since we've grown to enjoy them so much. Choices are real and affect the world and your characters.   If you are on the fence about it, take it from a guy who was on the fence about it for a while: just buy it. You won't regret it!

As a longtime pencil/paper/dice gamer, MMORPG player, and otherwise game enthusiast, this is one of the most enjoyable, interesting, and compelling games I've ever owned.  I find myself excited for \"Gloomhaven Sunday,\" looking forward to unlocking cards, events, skills, and the very occasional new character, all while unraveling an interesting storyline that forms as we make decisions.  We've played 20+ scenarios, over 100 hours of play, and still can't wait for the next time.  Pacing is very good, balance is very good, playability is very good.  There's a lot of \"devil in the details,\" taking care to ensure everyone consistently agrees how actions will play out goes a long way to enjoying the game.  Everyone we've introduced the game to has really enjoyed it.  We have friends asking to play again, more yet asking to try it out.

Once played 6 scenarios in one sitting (8 hours or so) and would easily do it again. Community has been amazing in giving advice and contributing their own ideas without spoiling anything. Highly recommend buying the removable sticker set for resetting the game once you're all done. We might need to buy an entirely new board :/", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Damdael", "rating": "10", "comment": "I have now played ten scenarios (dungeons) of Gloomhaven and I really like it. Sure, there are a few things to be picky about but overall it's addictive. Every scenario is an optimization puzzle and at least at our player count of three or four all of them have been quite well balanced. We've lost twice by a small margin and a few of the first scenarios were easy-ish. This is on normal difficulty. Most importantly it does what it promises. Dungeon delving without dice topped off with some light roleplaying and legacy aspects. I have a few other dungeon delving games (Descent and Doom) and Gloomhaven in my books is better than them.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "JaredMormont", "rating": "10", "comment": "We are up to level 4, so I feel confident in finally submitting my review. This is my greatest game of all time. When your casual gamer wife tells you weekly, \"I can't wait for Sunday to play gloomhaven!\" Or \"I thought I might like it, but I didn't realize I was going to love it!\" Then you know you have a winner.  Here are the top three reasons this game is my Top Game if All Time:  1) This game method of destroying the randomness of dice with MODIFIEABLE damage decks is simply brilliant. I hope this changes the industry and kills off dice chuckers in every genre: RPGs, Tabletop Minatures, Wargamming, etc.  2)  CO-OP move planning mechanism. The way you program your moves then adapt, without telling your teammates exactly what you are doing is incredible. Pandemic, innovative for it's time, falls flat in comparison. You now own your choices, no quarter backing. Plus the characters are unique enough so you really do know what your best moves are with little help from others.  3) Lore, story telling, character development, and production quality. All incredible values for the price paid.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Christophe_saeys", "rating": "10", "comment": "Fantastic game if you find some players to play with regularly. Unless you want to play it alone, which is also possible.    Be careful about the difficulty level and don't hesitate to raise it if you find it too easy.  The campaign keeps on surprising us and that is very nice. The event cards in between each scenario makes me think about the 'single-player adventure gamebooks' that were very popular in the eighties (yes, I am already in the mid-forties).  Before this game, we loved to play Descent. If you want to compare both, hereby some differences: - In general, I found Descent more 'beautiful' than Gloomhaven. Lots of nice Plastic figurines and nice tiles. Gloomhaven has only figurines for the heros and cardboards (not the best quality) for the monsters. The artwork for the tiles is a little basic.  - The rules of Descent are more complex than the ones in Gloomhaven. But do not expect a game that you play correctly as from the first time. Every now and then you discover some mistakes in your interpretation of the rules. The overall complexity of the rules in Gloomhaven is less than in Descent (no dice, less problems with line of sight, etc).  - Descent has a limited campaign mode without a real story. Gloomhaven has an extended campaign mode with a story and especially, with many choices you have to make during you campaign. Some people will tell you that there is no real story like in a role playing game. That is true (is it required from a boardgame?), but the story is interesting enough to want to continue following it.  - Descent is one (Overlord) player against all others. Gloomhaven is fully cooperative. As I am the one buying all the games in the group and reading all the rules, I always ended up as Overlord (me against all the others). And the only one reading the rules. And this of course, brings sometimes heavy interpretation discussions. In Gloomhaven, as everybody is equal, I have send the e-rulebook to all the players and asked them to check eventual rule-interpretation-problems. And if we discover that we made some mistakes in the rules (which happened almost every game until now), at least the others cannot blame me by saying it was at their disadvantage :-) - Descent can easily be played with other players every session. In Gloomhaven you can play individual scenarios if you want, but the real fun is to play the campaign(s). And that means playing with the same group of players  (But the campaign mode does not require to be played with the complete team).   You might think Gloomhaven is an expensive game. In our case, we did not play any other game (with this group) since we started to play Gloomhaven. And this will last for many more months. So, if you count the number of hours spend on playing Gloomhaven, this could end up as one of your cheaper games.  So, which game is the best? Although I loved to play Descent during many years, for me Gloomhaven is the absolute winner. It brings additional elements to in this category that did not exist yet (or at least not all elements together in one single game).   Gloomhaven is absolutely fantastic! Hopefully this sets a new standard for other designers to make such complete games in the future.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The game has a life of its own, and I\u2019m happy to be a part of the communities it created on Kickstarter, Facebook, here on BGG, and with friends and family.

We're veterans and huge fans of Dark Souls, Imperial Assault, and Mansions of Madness.. and I'm a huge fan of HeroQuest, and Gloomhaven tops them all. The game mechanics are unique (to us) and the strategy element is very high. Also, we love the co-op, yet we don't feel like one person always \"takes charge\" like in some other co-op games (ex. Panemic) that makes them less fun to us.

For a board game it's always fun. I like the tactical view of combat and a lot of options we have (not hack and slash). Reusable equipment is also a plus. OK, you have to spend time with the setup but, hey, it's not a 10 minutes game.  Ther art is really nice, the box is beautyful (actually it should not matter, but it is). The game has some quality issues here and there, they are cosmetical ones, actually. I love the miniatures.  This game is a must!", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

It's a replayable game,it has a lot of things to do.I like it, that it's a difficult cooperative game, where some things you can't share them with your teammates like battle and secret goals and the gold.

I can understand others not liking gloomhaven as they feel its too puzzle like and I can see their complaints. This game is for the video game player who likes CRPGs with a dash of D&D. I urge you to buy a game organizer ( I own the broken token one) this will help with setup and teardowns as well as keeping tokens in easy to access containers during play. They are not cheap but with 80+ campaigns and each has been several hours of gameplay, why wouldnt you want to spend on a solution to make it easier to bring to the table.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Limitations are having people to play with and having space to set it up - also, seriously, buy the organizer kit - I don't think we'd really have kept playing if we had to store all the zillions of pieces in zip lock bags.   It's just a really well done game that is a lot of fun. For those that enjoy table top miniature combat - it is Super fun. Last, it's also really fun for occasional guests who pop in as 'guest stars'. I wasn't sure if that would work well, but it really has. Can't wait for the expansion!", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The depth to this game is quite staggering,  It can take a while to setup and break down, keeping your game box organised is an absolute must.  If it is withing your reach i would recommend getting some kind of organiser or have a lot of zip lock bags available to make it easier on yourself. You should not perceive this as criticism though, the time it takes to setup the game and the different scenarios is just a reflection of the variation between scenarios and the depth of the game.  Also, if the thought of permanently altering the game with stickers sets off your ocd (like it does for me) removable stickers are available,  This game is truly a masterpiece.

{"username": "DantonTH", "rating": "10", "comment": "Jep. This is a great game. I had to wait for a one year to get this on the table. Last monday we finally started to play gloomhaven and we played from monday to saturday. I was on a vacation. So we played only gloomhaven (plus some sleep and beer)for six whole days! I never got bored or had any negative feelings. So there is no doubt how great this is! ...Okay one came to mind during our adventuring... i'm playing that crack-stone-chest-dude and he can be some times little difficult. You have to most of the time be more reactive than other classes (we encountered anyway) because Stone-man is usually in the slow end of iniative order and may do harm to allies sometimes. And some other reasons too. So it was little bit frustrating sometimes because you wanted to know most of the turns what others wanted to do beforehand. Other characters just wanted to run into melee combat early in the turn. But on the other hand i think stone-dude is very rewarding in a way it seemed to be very difficult to play sometimes. So it was not only hack'and'slash. great game 10/10", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Second scenario was almost as tight, with another win for us. They are all in, and I myself enjoyed the excellent story and challenge offered by this \"dungeon crawler.\" I could play several of these scenarios over again as stand-alone games, they are so well designed, exciting, and challenging. UPDATE: After 60 plays this game holds a solid 10, with great story-telling, diversity of engagements and player/monster characters, balanced scenarios, with a fun factor off the charts.

{"username": "Hie N Mighty", "rating": "10", "comment": "This game is my all time favorite game. It is as if D&D, and Skyrim had a baby.  The ability to create and upgrade your character. The beautiful and unique layout of each scenario. The multiple different outcomes and stories will keep me coming back for more playthroughs.  The character design and is gorgeous The scaling is perfect and allows for you to scale it yourself. The only downside is putting it back in the box since there is not a lot of room for all the pieces. I was able to craft my own, instead of buying one for $80  If you like choose your own adventure, card based, story driven, and exciting game play this game is for you.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "kartoffelopa", "rating": "10", "comment": "Outstanding in every aspect. Gloomhaven has everything a fantasy heavy gamer desires. If you are into Dungeon crawler, long term story telling or developing your character, this game is for you.  If your are into easy playable casual games, this game is NOT for you. Initial learning curve is high, if you do not have an experienced player in your group. Setup and organinzing the huge quantitiy of game material takes an inital effort as well.   A usual dungeon scenario takes about 2,5 hours.  The total quality of game design and long term playability is unmatched by any other game. Gloomhaven looks at all other dungeon crawlers and long term games and vows to avoid all their mistakes. The result is a game where there is almost nothing left to criticize.  This is a 10. The only 10 for the countless games I have played in my life. None did match it.  I played this about 30 times over the course of 8 months so far. It has lost nothing of its facszination, quite the opposite.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Qumpelblase", "rating": "10", "comment": "Ich wollte dieses Spiel sehr kritisch betrachten. Ich hasse Kampagnenspiele und kann auch mit Legacy-Elementen nicht wirklich viel anfangen (auch wenn eine gewisse Spannung mich immer wieder in ihren Bann zieht). Und wie gesagt: ich m\u00f6chte wirklich nicht jedes Hype-Spiel automatisch auch selber klasse finden. Ich setzt mich also total kritisch an dieses Spiel ran- w\u00fcnsche mir fast, dass es kacke wird- und habe 2 Stunden sp\u00e4ter ein neues Lieblingsspiel! Ja, der Aufbau dauert Ewigkeiten. Ja, man zerupft sich die Pappteile an den sehr festen Aufstellern. Ja, zu viert ist das Spiel nicht halb so gut wie mit weniger Spielern. Aber das sind alles Punkte, \u00fcber die ich hinwegsehen kann, weil die Stimmung im Spiel einfach fantastisch ist. Die Flavourtexte sind kurz, aber erzeugen trotdem Atmosph\u00e4re (ein gro\u00dfer Kritikpunkt bei anderen Kampagnenspielen ist, dass man 5 Seiten Geschichte vorliest, aber alle schon mit den Hufen scharren und zocken wollen- das ist hier deutlich besser). Beim Spielen f\u00fchle ich mich, als w\u00fcrde ich mich wirklich durch eine Horde Gegner k\u00e4mpfen; das liegt vorallem an den Charakterdecks, die meines Erachtens der Aspekt sind, der Gloomhaven einfach besonders macht. Man hat auf den Karten nicht nur thematische Effekte, die das Spiel einfach irgendwie spannend machen, es bietet auch spielerisch/taktisch interessante Entscheidungen- vorallem weil das Deck klein ist und man eigentlich alle Informationen dar\u00fcber vorm Spielen hat (und nicht einfach zuf\u00e4llige Karten zieht). Und damit nicht genug: die Mechanik des Levelns und der Rollenspielcharakter machen das Spiel sogar noch besser. Nach 60 Spielrunden hatten wir die Kampagne ein erstes Mal durchgespielt- da war unsere ganze Spielgruppe auch erst einmal satt und ganz froh, erst einmal eine Pause zu bekommen. Denn: Gloomhaven war f\u00fcr mich in manchen Runden sehr anstrengend. In manchen Squads waren die Charaktere zu schwach, in manchen zu stark. Oft hat man das Gef\u00fchl, dass manche Krieger nicht f\u00fcr zwei Spieler ausgelegt sind. Und dann kommt es schnell mal vor, dass man seinen Charakter hasst und einfach nur loswerden m\u00f6chte. Das war aber nur ganz selten der Fall; meistens \u00fcberwiegt die Lust, den neuen S\u00f6ldner zu spielen und wirklich kennenzulernen. Und deshalb haben wir mittlerweile auch Bock auf einen neuen Durchgang der Kampagne- mit neuen Entscheidungen und anderen Squads. Und das ist ein Zeichen daf\u00fcr, dass Gloomhaven ein bahnbrechendes Gesellschaftsspiel ist. [microbadge=3176]Strategy Game 2019", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Yes there are more immersive games out there but maybe none that creates such a deep world, such a vast amount of stuff to explore.   That might be overwhelming and you somehow have to commit  to it, but that is made easier than I thought. I actually dont have a very regularly gaming group for this one, which may sound odd. But I play it with my wife (who likes it but isnt that much into it as I am), with gaming friends (with whom I dont have the oppertunity with all too often) and solo. That all works in one campaign and it works very well. I really think this is a huge plus as otherwise I think it would have killed my enjoyment of this game whivh deserves to sit on that number 1 spot.  I recommend a setup solution (y.a.s.s. which I use or more expensive ones from various manufacturers). It really helps getting out this game regularly.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Our sessions are about 4-5h effective game time with 4 players (We are very slow...). 2 players is quicker, harder and also fun but not as fun. Incredible in so many ways. If you have the time, friends and table for it, just buy it - together.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Xardok", "rating": "10", "comment": "What a game. A part from some minor rules which are solely for balanceing purposes I think there is nothing wrong with this one. Within a couple of plays it had me addicted, always wanting to play on.  The combat mechanics are really well tought out, everything feels really balanced. Often times we win while knocking on death's door. With the beatiful, beatiful map I really have the feeling of an open world. I can go where ever I want. The various city- and road events make this game feel alive. The Stoytelling is loose, but well done. After 40-50 hours in, I am excited to see where it will lead up to.   The experiance thus far was exceptionally outstanding. I love it", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Kralizec", "rating": "10", "comment": "We bought this game last week, after I finished the rulebook we directly started. Within 4 Days, we played 5 times in 3 Scenarios.  Both of us truly enjoyed the game and game mechanics.   The first two times, though we of course struggled a bit with the rules, but everything is mentioned in the rulebook and just took a while to find the mentioned thing.  Two things I miss: 1. An introduction round. One round where the Basic rules are mentioned. As my gaming partner did not read the rules, she was a bit struggling what to do and what is best and stuff. So that in the first scenario she was already dead after 3 rounds. 2. Character overview; how is doing what? Where are the strengths of whom?  That would had helped to choose a character more suitable.  But on the other hand, I just choose my character based on the biography and I had to learn his strengths and weaknesses during the game, which makes fun.  I would say this is one of those games, I would play over and over again. The legacy mode, the character settings, the amount of Things, the battle mechanics, the typical roleplaygame events it is so much fun to play. Therefore 10/10 points from our side.  Next week we already invited some friends to encounter a dungeon with 4 People.  Besides, I recommend to buy a inlay, we bought the Gloombox from laserox.net", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "polybag1337", "rating": "10", "comment": "I have played numerous board games over the years, when some of my friends said this was the best game they had ever played I was very dubious.  The game takes a pretty long time to learn all of its systems, but once you do it is the deepest and perhaps the best constructed of any board game I have ever played.  The stories are memorable, and the fact that your progress is tracked between games is amazing (it works even if you dont get the same group of people each time).  The game is fully coop, and the combat is turn based (but you play your cards secretly so there is non of the One player telling everyone what to do, issue that alot of coop games have).  The box says 1-4 players, but I think it actually plays best with 2.  Please do your self a favor and pick this game up, it is truly exceptional in every way there is nothing else like it.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "burnstar", "rating": "10", "comment": "10x10 2019.  This game is huge.  I've played this around 40 times and that's less than half the quests.  And it still isn't really feeling stale or old.  It's the best dungeon crawling board game I've played.  The combat is tactical and fun.  The AI system for the monsters is really slick.  But it can slow down a little when there's a great many enemies of different types.  The campaign system is ridiculously big, detailed, and deep.  There's a bunch of different characters you can unlock each of which plays very differently.  The difficulty balance is spot on.  We usually win but barely so it's tense.  The story isn't quite as rich as an RPG, but it's pretty impressive for a board game.  Gloomhave easily lives up the hype.  If anything it's almost too much and too big.  I had a table where I could leave this set up for several months.  Otherwise setting it up and tearing it down would be very time consuming.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "jeffwolfe", "rating": "10", "comment": "We're doing it. We've started playing this Legacy-style dungeon crawl. Update after several scenarios. Lots of options. Lots of ways to improve your character, the party, and the city. You have more ability cards than you can take on any given scenario, so you can craft your hand based on the scenario, your battle goal, and other individual objectives.  You might be looking to level up, or you might be looking to loot some gold so you can buy that shiny new equipment in the city. Like Dead of Winter, your private objectives influence your actions to make it seem like you're not always fully cooperating. There's no traitor, though, so you're never trying to sabotage the scenario. The rewards for completing a scenario are high enough that you never want to fail. Ultimately your character is looking to retire so he can pass the torch to your next character (metaphorically speaking; nothing actually changes hands). You're constantly unlocking new content as you find out about he various places in the word and the characters therein.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Groglox", "rating": "10", "comment": "Simply the best board game I have ever played. It feels like an incredible video game in board game form - which may have you asking 'well why don't I just play a video game', which is a reasonable response. I think somehow this game create a beautiful tactile and social loop of fun that cannot be achieved with a digital product. It is all about how the game *FEELS* to play.  Some thoughts: For example, adding a new upgrade card to your deck and taking out bad ones *FEELS* so good when you top deck your new +3 modifier, or you go a whole scenario without getting any more -1 modifiers because your perk took them out the last time you leveled up in town.  Another thing I have always loved is the *IDEA* of dungeons and dragons. I say idea because the bits of dungeons and dragons that I like the most, are the dungeons, and less so the meandering bits in town where the narrative can slow down to a crawl and run out of time, or I am left up to the quality of my DM, or maybe we don't have a DM, or maybe someone sat out for a week, etc etc. That isn't to say D&D is bad, it just isn't for me. That being said, Gloomhaven takes the parts of dungeons and dragons I love: Interesting NPCs, elaborate driving stories that have you uncovering piece by piece of the larger puzzle through each decent into the wilderness like an archaeologist removing dirt and dust from old bones, slowly revealing the scale and scope of the creature below. Gloom haven does this beautifully and with such an economy of words as to constantly push you right into the fun bits - the dungeon.  Gameplay:  This game is full of stuff and little details and mechanics and rules, but the funny thing is, it never feels like it is heavy or weighed down by them. The core gameplay is fun and rewarding - enough so that even without the massive campaign and trappings, the game includes a random dungeon and monster setup engine that on its own would have made an amazing game. The manual is organized in such a way that afte you have completed the initial scenario and wrapped your head around the basic gameplay loop and turn structure, you can just play. Anytime you run into something new or a question, the back has a quick visual index to guide you right where you need to go and not worry about the rest of the bits. As a resault by the time you finish your first 3-4 scenarios in the campaign (about 1-2 hours each depending on the number of players), you will find yourself no longer needing to consult the manual at all for almost anything. Gloomhaven puts as much information as it can right in front of you.  The Bad:  While I just spent time praising the manual, I will note that for the very first time you play, it does a terrible job of explaining where to start, and what you do and don't need to know. I highly recommend watching a how to play video or two before your first session.  Gloomhaven is big, like really big. There are so many pieces and bits that without proper organization you will lose 10-15 minutes per game just trying to find things and make sense of the the visual clutter around you. If you are thinking about buying Gloomhaven, understand there is an unwritten contract that comes with it, to buy or provide your own organization method to solve this - what is included in the box is not remotely close to sufficient. Note that this doesn't mean you have to spend $80-100 to buy a fancy organizer, there are many inexpensive solutions I have seen from fishing tackle boxes to just lots of zip lock baggies with colored tape to identify them quickly. I personally enjoy this type of thing when it comes to my hobbies, but it's worth keeping in mind.  Lastly, while the game does support 1-4 players, I recommend playing with 2-3. While the turn to turn game play is not complex, the game time added per scenario by adding additional players which adds additional monsters may slow the game down to a pace you may not enjoy. I elected to stick with two people for now with the option to add a third later. Playing solo is doable, but it will have you playing as two characters anyway, so might as well bring a friend.  Overall:  Gloomhaven is not a game for people who don't like games. That isn't to say it is insanely complex or far to confusing to a layperson - it's not. It is more a reflection of the commitment Gloomhaven asks of the players, and what Gloomhaven offers them. It offers the most classic version of tabletop gameplay - dungeon crawling in an intimidating package with thousands of bits to keep track of and understand across weeks and months of story and gameplay. This is not the game for your dinner party.  The game feels like a counterpoint to overcomplicated rules, games more focused on included miniature figures than gameplay, games trying to widen the scope and open-ended ness of what is possible, or even games trying to simplify to attract a wider audience with faster setup/pacing/gameplay. Gloomhaven knows exactly what it is, and sets out to be the best version of that, and nothing else, while sitll learning from what has come before. For those who regularly read about and play games, it comes across as a breath of fresh air - for those players will notice all the little details and lengths Cephalofair games has gone to in crafting the game.  While I am writing this review without having played everything, part of the joy of Gloomhaven is the mystery of what comes next - what will I discover, unlock, and find next. Right now my playgroup can't wait to find out.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Fizi", "rating": "10", "comment": "Tremendously good. Card mechanism for combat takes away the \"I have to remember all my options\" and the \"alpha player\" issues associated with most dungeoncrawlers, makes it more like Mage Knight in that you can always see your options and you can still choose among them.  NB I play with a few modified rules, in particular a vastly higher difficulty level which is compensated for by being full co-op (all loot is shared evenly regardless of who gets it, etc). And a few other changes (e.g. max 1 of each character class, items are limited so newer characters often have to buy more 'creative' items once the shop runs out of stamina potions!)  Manages to do co-op properly, with only 1 artificial restriction on your ability to communicate: can't state initiative numbers. This is sooooo much better than most co-ops, which have to use a stronger restrictive method (e.g. a time limit).", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Scotticus1985", "rating": "10", "comment": "This is the game I (and my wife especially) had been waiting for. I had been into DnD and similar games since high school, and I have always been on the lookout for games that best simulate this experience without one player having to dedicate a lot of their time to taking on the role of the dungeon or game master (I myself having written and run two different DnD campaigns with gaming groups; the second included my wife). I had played Descent with some friends, which was great, but it didn't have the depth of DnD, and one person still had to be separate in their role of the overlord. My wife and I bought Mage Knight as it allowed the depth of DnD without a DM. Unfortunately, the depth of the game often came with too many choices and esoteric symbols to remember that she would get overwhelmed and I usually walked away with a headache from all the strategizing when we completed the most challenging scenarios. With Gloomhaven, it was the first time we found a game with great depth of strategy without being overwhelmed by mechanics that were esoteric or byzantine. The use of character, monster, and battle decks allowed for us to really get into our characters without worrying about memorizing every little fiddly rule. The theme and story really come to life with the scenario descriptions, road and city cards, and the choices we can make to move through the game; we felt like we were playing a DnD campaign. Best of all, the legacy aspect gave us a chance to learn our characters and how they interact with each other over multiple sessions as they grew in strength. After trying many different games I cannot tell you how overjoyed I was to have my wife say that she really liked this game and was excited to play again; from our first scenario played onward.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}
{"username": "spoonman", "rating": "10", "comment": "I\u2019ve only played a few scenarios but...wow! Gloomhaven has changed boardgaming for me. The game system is unapologetically complex. At its core is a dungeon combat system that pays some tribute to the new generation of dungeon crawlers like Descent but refines the premise to a highly strategic and finely balanced fantasy  brawler that relies on careful hand management and board awareness over dice rolling. While there is a randomizer deck and uncertainty about who gets the first lick in, I felt like my decisions had the greatest impact on the outcome.   Beyond the core combat, Gloomhaven continues to impress. Changing map locations and effects, choose your own adventure style events between missions, evolving strategies from upgrading cards (by stickering them!), and writing that\u2019s... actually pretty good.   Outside of the game is the thrill factor of opening little packets of skill and character cards, story things (I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s what those sealed envelopes are), and minis that are in individually sealed boxes reminiscent of heroclix or lego mini fig singles. It\u2019s a joyful process of discovery digging into that box of stuff.   And what a box it is. The sheer amount of cards, location tiles, creatures, and tokens gave ample opportunity for some components to have issues. But no, they are immaculate. Each money token, every tiny sticker, every card is at the top of its... game. I didn\u2019t find any frayed edges or ugly art. The WHOLE thing is beautiful. All of it.   Sure, I can find a complaint if I really tried. I don\u2019t like the permanently stickering my pretty components. Maybe some of the rules are a bit fiddly. But realistically, both of those are things a great number of players will find add to the experience.  So yeah, my expectation for board games has just leveled up. A new generation has been defined.  There\u2019s what came before Gloomhaven and there\u2019s Gloomhaven.

{"username": "gloukas", "rating": "10", "comment": "Finally got the chance to play it. So far i played 3 scenarios solo (some of them twice due to failure) and really enjoyed them. I tried 2 characters out of the starting 6, but still found that the variation of skills for each character is big, so every change you make in skills change the tactic you follow and in general your gameplay. The AI behind the monsters is well-made making you to think twice before any move. Taking into consideration the time i spent to unpunch the components (around 1.5 hour while storing it into Gloombox) it seems that the game is very deep and there are so many hours of playtime alone or with friends and so many variations that you will never think that you lived a same moment in the game twice.  As for the cons of the game i have the following: 1) The game is huge and heavy (around 10kgs...12.5kgs with Gloombox), making it impossible to carry it with you. 2) You definitely need an insert to store all of the components. 3) It could get quite expensive considering the fact that besides the base game you will need to buy an insert and a lot of sleeves.  In conclusion i think the game is awesome and really enjoy playing.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "tomcools", "rating": "10", "comment": "This game is an absolute beast. There is so much in this box, yet it never feels overwhelming.   Classes and scenarios are incredibly balanced. No DICE! I am a notoriously bad roller, so no dice is a big thing for me.  There is a lot of admin to do at some points but this is something we enjoy. I take great joy in cleanly unpacking and repacking the box.  Already bought the expansion (Forgotten Circles) and am waiting to open that one until we unlock all the characters in the base box. (2 left).  Can't recommend this game enough if you are into Dungeon Crawlers.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

I would consider buying a copy if I moved away or possibly later to play with my boys.    Easily the top played game for me of 2018/2019.  It was the only game in my 2018 10x10 that I completed, and then continued to play for a total of 20+ plays in 2018.  Finally after 25 or so sessions retired my first character and we have retired and unlocked only 4 characters of the unlockable characters so far.  Play this still at least monthly.  If given the chance to play this or to have our regularly scheduled game night, I might choose Gloomhaven first.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "carlosyabrudy", "rating": "10", "comment": "From the moment this huge box arrives that dwarfs most other board games, and you start to unpack everything, before you have EVEN STARTED to play, you can see the value in what you have paid for.   The pieces are well printed, the immense detail, figures in boxes, opening boxes and envelopes to the embedded campaign story are a great part of the experience in not knowing what\u2019s coming and gradually adding more cards to the deck.   The levelling up system is cool and in general works very well.   I love the artwork and design of the whole thing. Manual is easy to read and there are now enough videos on YouTube of people explaining plus support.   Great investment for a hugely long campaign. I bought the Sinister fish removable stickers for \u00a38 and printed some of the resources on here so as not to mark the main board up so with the base cost, you are very well supported after if you wanted to have round 2 when you have children later in life to add more players etc. I can see why this is one of the best games ever made and number 1 on here.   I prefer area control but this is enjoyable also.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "PonchoPanda89", "rating": "10", "comment": "I come from a long background of RPGs, dungeon crawlers, Dungeons and Dragons, World of Warcraft, hell even playing knights with my childhood friends (hitting each other with sticks). This game has somehow combined my favorite components of all of these things and turned it into what I know consider my favorite game of all time; which was really hard to say considering my love for munchkin, runebound, and betrayal at house on the hill. It allows the players to decide how their adventure will go on a lot of the scenarios and campaign which gives the story a large personal touch. Plus, you are not expected to stick with your one character the whole campaign. Your characters have motives and goals they want to complete, and just as in real life, they also want to retire to florida and rest some day when their life goal is complete. So when a character's goal is fulfilled you start a new character with new motives and new abilities. The game's combat is a refreshing splash of card play versus a dungeons and dragons style of free skill usage (within reason). Since some abilities are only used once a scenario and then lost there is great risk and strategy involved in making your character's stamina last the entire encounter and not just cramp up after kicking down the dungeon door. The cherry on this gloomhaven cake is the added, but not totally necessary map elements. The map of all the discovered or acknowledged places in the area is a great addition. It makes you feel like there is a whole world at your fingertips. And for those crazy bastards we call \"achievement hunters\" there is a whole system of achievements both personal and global you can earn as well. If you haven't indulged yourself already into the delicacy that is Gloomhaven, then grab a fork and get to it!", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Grimolyn", "rating": "10", "comment": "Love it! Highly recommend this to anyone who loves board games and dungeon crawlers. It's also really great for people who are turned away by the RPing in D&D. So far I've enjoyed it in solo mode and as a two-person campaign with the occasional extra player or two. The game scales really well depending on how many players you have and how hard you want the encounter to be. And with all the random encounters, things to unlock, personal quests, and ways to play/customize your character, this game has A LOT of replay value! Also, there are several really great apps for Android and Apple that make running and keeping track of the game easier and quicker. Overall, I really enjoy this game and am super stoked on the expansion coming out soon!", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "nicolasuviedo", "rating": "10", "comment": "outstanding game, I always enjoy playing. A great solo game, a great game played with people that also like dense games.  The cons of this game is tightly linked with the best parts, and those are: + preparation time and complexity. +Lack of recurrent players and advancement of and attachment to  characters  Thankfully there are solutions to some of the issues: +For preparation time, using a box organiser is a must, and at least other player has to know how to set up the board (and playing several games in a row minimises preparation time ) + using combat tracking apps(exist for every platform) minimises the preparation and playing time considerably. A lot of micro management(and small pieces) is avoided by using an app. +I found that creating a \"visitor\" version for each class helps people jump in at any point of the campaign, If they want to keep playing that character in the future, they keep it and I create another character.  In general, every con is related to: minimises play time. but every play time is enjoyable, is a real cooperative game, where playing with people is actually better than playing solo(unlike most cooperative games). The game is challenging enough, and it can become harder or easier with almost no effort.  imo: awesome game! if you don't mind some prep time, this is worth playing!", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

This game has nearly completely captured my attention by its breadth, creativity, ingenuity, creativity, and flexibility.  I hardly find any other new game interesting.  Terraforming Mars - which I love - currently is of no interest to me after playing this. --The Gloomhaven Helper app on my iPad makes this game much quicker to play.  A must purchase.  I also use GloomsteR, which is also great.   Initial rating: 8.5 Just getting started.  Very challenging for me.  I'm really enjoying it.  I see my rating going higher as I play more, but I want to leave room to grow.  After an initial random scenario, I followed the counsel of various online folks and started using the Gloomhaven Helper app.  I actually enjoy the manual flipping of cards and placing of damage tokens, but finding everything and getting that all set up just takes a bit too long when the app can do so much for you.  I reckon I'll use it every time.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "JetSetGo", "rating": "10", "comment": "An intimidating, 22-lb box contains some of the deepest tabletop gaming I've tried that isn't named DnD. A not so insignificant amount of homework is needed to suss out what all of its contents do. The reward is a game designed to really feel evolving like a video game. If played by the rules, a hefty amount of story branching is possible.  Players choose from one of 6 starting classes and tries to survive multiple scenarios while attempting to complete side-objectives to unlock new gear and classes.  It reminds me of a tabletop version of CRPGs like Baldur's Gate. While the game says a limit of up to fpour players, the game can reasonably accomodate a 5th player though some extra stuff will needed to be printed. Anything more is not really advisable.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "ia_hwks", "rating": "10", "comment": "I bought this game to play with my son.  After much anticipation (and several hours pleasurable insert building and game organizing) we finally got to play several scenarios and I felt I could write a review.  This game is a blast.  Worth the wait and all the organizing.    I was a little concerned because I've seen some comments and talked to a couple of GH players that suggested this is much better with three or four players than 2 (one even refused to play with less than three).  However, after 6 scenarios in the campaign I can say we've had a blast and I feel the ~$250 I've got invested in the game, insert/storage is well worth it.    The rules are a bit complicated but not so complex that they are burdensome to learn.  While there was and still is quite a bit of referring back to the rule book we can usually find what we are looking for pretty quickly.  There is a nice quick reference on the back that acts as a visual index to help you find rules pages quickly.    While we are still pretty early into our campaign I will definitely say this is our favorite game.  There are some apps that can help with tracking health and managing scenarios but so far we prefer to play it analog.    The fact that I can get my 16 year old son to spend hours hanging out with me must mean there is pure magic in the box.  :)", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "porkchop_tw", "rating": "10", "comment": "--- Update --- With about a dozen plays down rating goes from 9 to 10. Perfect dungeon crawler with a legacy aspect. Great game.  --- Update --- With Brute/Spellweaver I've cleared scenario 1, 2, and 4 and leveled up. Leveling up is really fun and exciting plus I got a treasure chest for the first time in scenario 4 and can't wait to try it out. I keep on thinking about this game so rating goes from 8 to 9. Lets see if the rating will go up to 10 by the end of our campaign wherever this game takes us. =)  Got to play this game 2-players w/ fellow BGGer on TTS. What a monster of a dungeon crawl but I can see there is a learning curve on how to manage your deck w/o running out of cards fast. I suspect this game is toughest at 2-player count and will be easier with more.  Edit: After reading guide, Spellweaver and Scoundrel are the hardest duo for 2-players. Will switch to Brute and try.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "theuselessgod", "rating": "10", "comment": "An absolute unit of a game with honestly dozens of hours of content (if not hundreds) that scales extremely well and has an absurd amount of fun, engaging legacy elements.  The game plays completely differently with more players as well. Two players is a heavy tactical game. Three is still tactical but with an element of chaos. Four players is fantastic, organized chaos.  The only downside is you need a ton of space available in order to enjoy it (as set-up and tear-down are improved if you have a dedicated play area) and the story itself in the game isn't particularly exciting (especially the ending). However, its still just so damn good I don't really care.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "waashman", "rating": "10", "comment": "Mechanics: the enemy AI decks are probably the shining mechanic of this game. different enemies have different skills that make all unique. The hero's card system is great when fighting and exploring but can become problematic in the less conventional missions as they were clearly not made for them. elements are fun but easily forgotten. gold and exp are well balanced although some items and enchantments do require a bit of gold grinding. the damage modifier deck is truly brilliant and I hope more games choose it over dice in the future. Overall, they work great together and create a fun experience.   Rules/ Booklets: a bit hard to grasp at first but the rulesbook is wonderfully written and organized. rules lookup is easy making only line of sight, recommended dungeon level, and certain AI situations requireing a deeper source. Missions are numerous and branch in fun but sometimes difficult to follow/ remember ways. Loved reading the prologue and epilogue for every mission.   Art/ Materials: materials are easily the weakest part of the game as the cardboard wares out pretty quickly given how much they will be used. expect superglue to be needed. The back pages of the mission book started to tear and fallout after a while. Art for the game is all above average and numerous given the amount of components used in the game. each enemy/ hero look unique and the stickers matching the background of the world map simply made me more eager to unlock more missions to complete my board.  Theme: It is truly a DM-less DnD experience. The mechanics and level design are perfect at making every mission feel like you only just made it by the skin of your teeth. My group audibly cheered when my friend managed to pull a crit to defeat a boss we thought for sure would kill us. I am honestly shocked at how much fun it was simply learning about the world and influencing it through certain decisions in missions choices as well as the city/road cards.  Group Interaction: Turns can feel a bit too personal at times, preventing meaningful discussions late into a mission. I highly recommend roleplaying to help prevent this. I had a group of 3 which felt good as I never felt like there was too much downtime. Enemy AI deck was great at facilitating discussion.

Die Immersion einer Geschichte und das Kampfsystem, sowie die Atmosph\u00e4re ist der Wahnsinn. Allein, zu zweit oder auch mit drei oder Vier Spielern Klasse.  Organizer sind aufgrund der Materialf\u00fclle ein Muss. Kostet daher zwar noch extra, aber f\u00fcr den Spielspass und der Menge an gebotenen Spielstunden ist das Hauptspiel sowieso ein Schn\u00e4ppchen.  Gloomhaven ist gerade auch f\u00fcr Einsteiger sehr leicht zu lernen (ich spiel auf Englisch, deutsch w\u00e4r noch krass leichter) verliert dadurch aber nichts an Komplexit\u00e4t und Spieltiefe. Neue Charaktere per Legacy Effekt zu finden und Freizuschalten ist zudem einer der genialsten Ideen ever", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

But this one just knocks it out of the park. The description of the publisher fits game perfectly: a euro-inspired, tactical combat system paired with a evolving RPG world, full of hidden content and things to uncover. The most audacious and grandiose game I have ever seen or played. And it just delivers. Gloomhaven has set a VEEEERY high bar for the genre, and for boardgaming in general.   For the moment, this is my favorite game, and I'll always admire how insanely great this game is. ", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

So I bought it the week before finals. Upon opening it, it took me an hour and a half to figure out what was going on and another hour and a half to play for the first time with a buddy of mine. It took up an entire room. Long story short, I loved it and I proceeded to play it eight times that week and two more times during finals (not the best choice, but awesome nonetheless). The only complaint I have is that the packaging could be better (there were some mistakes we made, although they were minor). Overall, I love this game and would highly recommend it to someone who enjoys games which are more complex. Lots of hours of playtime.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

An '8' is pretty good for me considering dungeon crawls and \"kill stuff\" is one of the less interesting types of games.  Still I do like the hand and card management of the scenarios.  The scenarios are definitely more than just chucking dice and hoping for hits.  And the campaign piece is really interesting.  This is part of the game that really shines for me and the kids in terms of leveling, items, characters, goals, prosperity, reputation, story progression, etc.  I'm spending way too much time thinking about this game and wanting to get it to the table.  I cannot deny it a 9...bumping from 8 to 9.  I might as well bump it up to a 10 now that we've done a few retirements.  The kids really enjoy it and are excited about the retirements and new characters.  The fact I really like it and they request it if we go a couple of weeks without playing is worth another point.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "FallenJedi", "rating": "10", "comment": "This game is so much fun. Seeing scenarios play out turn after turn, hour after hour, only to be completed (or not) with the entire party at the brink of exhaustion, is entertainment at its finest.   My friends and I find ourselves talking about recently played scenarios days or even weeks after they took place. I managed to not buy this game for a while because I considered myself only a casual board game player (not to mention the how expensive I considered it to be). I am very glad, however, that I convinced myself to get this game. It has already paid for itself in terms of enjoyment and hours played, and it will continue to do so with the many many scenarios we have left to play and characters we have yet to unlock.  One thing i would recommend is finding a way to organise all of the elements of the game. This will greatly improve your set up time, and helped us get to the actual game play much, much faster.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Arrived Jan 2017 KS with minis Words fail me about how much stuff there is included in one of the biggest (and chuffing heaviest) game boxes I have seen in recent years - and I backed Conan. This is very good value for sheer components alone - I hope the gameplay is as good as anticipated.  Excellent game - I've started the solo campaign with a view to having guest players take over characters as I go along if they are interested in playing it. Very tough start but getting the hang of it now. A very good contender for my own game of the year 2017 at the moment.  I've never rated anything 'Game of the Decade'. This is currently my 'Game of the Decade' - if it was easy, I would not give it this accolade but the theme and strategy requirements are simply brilliant.  This game is so difficult yet so fascinating and strategically challenging I cannot praise it enough. I like the fact that just when I think I have sorted out a scenario I lose yet again, but then i am able to lower the difficulty level to make it 'just' possible to complete.

I played this game over 200 hours and unlocked all characters.  Unfortunately I think I am burned out from playing so much.  I do not think it is one I will play with my kids due to the demons in the game.  My wife is adamant against about playing games with demons.  Happy wife happy home as they say.  Game has been sold to supplement purchasing Too Many Bones.  -Should this game be a 10 if I sold it?  I did for all intents and purposes finish the campaign.

The depth of strategy and tactics are great, the characters and enemies are unique and mostly original, and the sense of progression by the legacy-based system really gives it staying power. After playing more than 80 times, I can say the high initial cost is worth the investment. The only downsides are the sheer number of rules, the setup/tear-down/maintenance associated with such a massive game, and the amount of time required to play. But the game play itself is really enjoyable and is the best board game I've ever played.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The amount of fresh new content and components available in the box for $100 is insane. Forget playing D&D or any other role-playing/dungeon crawling game for two years as you tackle over 95 scenarios which each take about four hours to complete. This is what every legacy game should strive to be.  Edit: 10/15/2018: 60 scenarios, 12 characters, and hours upon hours of time later, I stand by many of the statements I made previously. The only comments I will make is that while the combat is intensely strategic and fun, the actual storytelling in the game falls a bit short in my opinion. The \"final\" scenario (51) was quite difficult, but I felt a bit hallow after we completed it, as if nothing really changed in the world, the way you would expect to feel the impact while playing a D&D game. I've demoted the game to a 9.8 from a 10, and may demote it further in the future if I decide to never play it again.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

By far the worst part is the setting up and tearing down, you're looking at like 30 min for that combined. But the fact that you can customize your own deck, level up skills in a way, the over-arching narrative has so many paths to go and choose from. Lots of play value and lots of fun. It's actually thrilling and fulfilling to get through a scenario, similar to Pandemic Legacy feeling of beating a mission.

{"username": "jkientzy", "rating": "9.8", "comment": "What a game\u2026   Context:      I enjoy a variety of board games that vary in style and in difficulty but favor strategic and thematic games. I have never played a true role playing game, and prior to Gloomhaven, I have never played a dungeon crawler. Thus far, I have played 19 scenarios in a Gloomhaven campaign in a three player party, a few random scenarios in a two player party, and a few solo scenarios. My party has about one play session a month and tries to play 2-4 scenarios (3-6 hours) each time that we meet.       I have the Meeple Realty organizer, which has been excellent. As many others have said, the vastness of this game absolutely demands some sort of intentional storage solution in order to reduce setup/tear down and increase playtime.       After our first few sessions, we also decided to use one of multiple free and well-made apps (Gloomhaven Dungeon Master) that greatly assists in managing the monster stats/movement. I don\u2019t see this as a necessity for enjoyment, but it does improve our experience by making the game much less fiddly (less setup/tear down and less maintenance) and speeding up the playtime for each mission.  My Experience:      Plain and simple, my entire group has had an incredible amount of fun exploring the world of Gloomhaven, and all of us say that it is the most fun we\u2019ve ever had playing a board game. We plan to continue the entire campaign, play some of the bonus content and purchase future expansions. We enjoy the unique characters and world, the strategic combat, the interesting story, and the (mostly) cooperative play. The lite legacy elements only add to the experience \u2014 some of our most fun experiences have centered around opening a new character and learning an entirely different play style or deciding, which path to take in a branching storyline.      Gloomhaven demands little to no roleplaying but also leaves a lot of room for people to add in lite roleplaying elements. My group leans into these opportunities by creating basic back stories that build off of the \u201clife goals\u201d that we selected, maintaining a quest log that adds in more descriptive story components to our adventures, and making story/quest decisions based on our characters\u2019 motives and personality.  Barriers to Enjoying/Liking Gloomhaven: 1. If you don\u2019t like cooperative games, I would avoid Gloomhaven. 2. If you don\u2019t enjoy strategic/puzzly games, I would avoid Gloomhaven. i.e. \u201cI have 10 combat/movement cards to choose from. I need to choose 2. None of the options are wrong but some are much better than others.\u201d Repeat this process and find good combos. 3. If you don\u2019t enjoy thematic games with a persistent story line, I would avoid Gloomhaven. The \u201crandom dungeons\u201d are fun, but the game shines most with the ongoing campaign. 4. Not having a somewhat consistent group (2-4) would make the game harder to enjoy, unless you want to play solo. 5. Not having an organization solution would make the game less enjoyable.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

This is the hard part of the game, that you have to mange your cards really good and I love it XD.  We never lost a scenario, even we winded up the level mostly on hard (it was sometimes really close), but it was still funny. Our last configuration of the group was to strong I assume ----- small spoiler------- a hardcore tank, a powerful ranged char and a super situational flexible char, ------- small spoiler end ---------.  The campaign is quite interesting and the different characters make the game every time really enjoyable. You enjoy the characters and if you get close to the retirement you feel mostly that you want to try something new, that is a real surprising effect XD.

This game takes us waaaay longer than the 2 hours per scenario advertised on the box: setup is horrendous as is tearing down afterwards; there's a significant amount of overhead in character maintenance, campaign maintenance and grabbing the right cards to use with a specific character before the scenario - as well as choosing the cards for the scenario from the active pool. However, we've radically changed the way that we do setup and this has knocked 33% off the time it takes us to cycle through a complete session. Nevertheless, it takes us a long time to play a scenario, because we approach it as a Euro, not as an Ameritrash game. Lots of thinking, optimisation and discussion.  All that being said, it ranks as one of the most enjoyable games that I've ever played. It falls just short of Arkham Horror and Concordia.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "negatrev", "rating": "9.5", "comment": "This is an incredible game. The core of it is a strategic combat puzzle. But it definitely feels like you're fighting, rather than puzzle solving. The card-play is a little reminiscent of Gears of War, but better as it's your own pre-built deck (from limited class options). Every confrontation feels tight and challenging. We've only leveled-up once so far, but that felt like a big change and buying items makes a large difference too.  The progress in the larger world is rewarding and exciting. We even stuck our map-board on the games room wall :)", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "sucrates", "rating": "9.5", "comment": "Solid dungeoncrawler. Gameplay is a bit puzzly, so this one requires more brains than the usual dungeoncrawler type game. This is both a pro and a con, as usually I break out these type of games when I just want to sit back, relax and whack some skulls.  That being said, the puzzly part itself is excellent, and if you do have the braincells to spare the fights are really cool and certainly more involved as 'move up to the dude up to my movement allowance, whack skull, get whacked, whack again, creature dies, loot, repeat' as present in so many of its competitors.  What elevates the game is the fact that it is set in a complete campaign world that actually feels pretty alive. I'm NOT rating that into the 7.5 I'm giving because as though it does add to the immersion between levels and when setting up, it has no effect on the levels themselves. Also, the game is so big it is nearly impossible to set up with a regular group: it is a complete world in and of itself. And though it is an excellent skirmisher, it is a boardgame, which means artificial limitations, which mean it is inferior to a well-run role-playing game. Also, it is heavy (non-portable), pricy and the lack of a decent insert is killing for setup.  However... it completely kills Descent. It completely kills Heroquest, D&D adventure game, D&D Ravenloft (or any of that series) or almost any other fantasy themed skirmish game. Simply because of its solid gameplay. For that, and for its completeness, I almost feel I'm not giving this a high enough rating. Following BGG rating suggestions: I'm not suggesting it to others as it is a game people really should buy into: a casual skirmish game is only so-so, this needs to be played as part of a campaign.  Being a boardgame, it is the closest thing to an actual role-playing game I've ever seen, but I'd still prefer a well-run roleplaying game over Gloomhaven. For me I think it just scratches this role-play itch.. leaving me wanting to role-play more instead of playing Gloomhaven. But if you do have the group, like fantasy themed skirmish games, like role-playing but don't want or cannot find someone to act as overlord/DM/Gamemaster, and if you're not planning to have a collection of games to choose from pending on occasion and party, this could be THE game for you. If all those factors describe you, up my rating with 2 points for this game: solid 9.5.  It is an awesome game to just delve into. It makes you realize you simply don't have time enough to explore everything of it. Next to 7th Continent, this game will look at me for too long before finally getting played through all the way. Though this offers the chance of finally clearing out a major part of my games collection, keeping only the unique ones... like this one.  [EDIT Feb 2019] So, I've succesfully pitched this game as a successor to a regular role-play setup where the DM quit because of time issues. We're on a low frequency, playing on average one scenario in three weeks. However, the game delivers all my expectations as a substitute for actual role-playing. Great game, evenings are always looked forward to. 9.5 as rating for campaign mode stands.   Have updated my rating from a 7.5 to a 9.5 to actually show what the experience is if you play it as it is meant to be played: as a campaign. If you're not, just deduct 2 points. Meaning: still ok, but probably there are other, better games you can play in that time.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Mossquito", "rating": "9.5", "comment": "Great dungeon crawler, with innovative mechanics (although very similar to Mage Knight) and great storyline (so far)  I am playing this with my brother so we don't get to play very often, but it is such a great campaign that we will be returning to it for years and years  I think this is a great co-op with very little quarterbacking.  So far the different characters feel very different, and the enemies, while largely follow the same mechanics, each have different abilities that make me wonder how the creator managed to fit so much into this game for the price point  Definitely something that will take a long time to complete, and requires a significant investment of time on the part of the players.

I have one campaign going with a friend, and am going to start a separate campaign solo.  For those who may be doing the same as me, I urge you to get the interactive map from the files section here, as it will allow you to preserve the board and keep achievements separate from your main campaign.  Will more than likely update in the near future to record my thoughts on the gameplay solo, but as a co-op, it is stellar if you have people you really enjoy playing with.  Update: After a week or so of solo play, I'm still in love with this game.  I bought various things to make the organization of the game a lot better, so setup is a breeze now.  Even with the amount of time put in, I'm currently only through 3 scenarios with my solo party, so this is a VERY meaty game, to say the least.  I will try and update this review again once I've made any sort of considerable progress in the game, but as it stands now, it's absolutely fantastic in my opinion.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Jassokissa", "rating": "9.5", "comment": "Time to update: I started rating this game as 8 after the first 2 scenarios. Upgraded it to 9 after 10 or so scenarios. Now after 22 scenariois I just have to bump it up to 9.5 (I do not have rated any game a 10, ever. I'd say the closests ones getting a ten from me so far would have been Imperial Assault and Bloodbowl)  Our gaming group likes the legacy aspect of the game (I never sell my old games so I don't have to worry about resale value). You play through missions and are slowly rewarded with more of the story opening up, making decisions etc. At first leveling up and getting more equipment/stuff/info/scenarios seemed slow, but after 22 or so missions the speed seems just fine.  Pros:  +I really like the inbuilt timer system with loosing cards, it works really well. +Lot's of content (There is some repetition to the missions, but that was supposed to be expected) +Characters play really differently (Only seen mostly the starting characters so far) +Legacy campaign (I don't mind putting stickers on the game board or marking stuff with a pen on the components, I do like the storytelling part of the game and cant wait to read out more stuff, after grinding through yet another mission) +Monsters have variety in them  Cons: - Setup and tear down time, it's really one of those games that you can't just call your friends \"Let's play a quick scenario or 2 after work\". But with this amount of stuff in the game, that cannot be helped. I do not store the game components in the box they came in, so that speeds up the setup quite a bit though.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "rubiks75", "rating": "9.5", "comment": "CANT WAIT FOR THIS TO ARRIVE!!! Finally after nine months of waiting it\u2019s here!!!! It\u2019s ENORMOUS!!! Seriously I knew it was big, but once it\u2019s in front of you it\u2019s teuly impressive in terms of content. Can\u2019t wait to play it, sadly been that long the friend was going to play with has left Leeds and think it\u2019s too big a commitment for my wife, who\u2019s a casual gamer at best!   UPDATE When this arrived I was thinking yea he it\u2019s huge, loads of content, but not massively polished and not sure about card driven combat, maybe it\u2019s overrated.... WRONG so WRONG it\u2019s absolutely brilliant. It\u2019s absolutely epic, entrancing and the card system works amazingly well even from level one the card system feels fresh and fun.   I think somehow with all the hugely polished sets from the likes of FFG, that we have been spoiled by in recent years sometimes forget the truly important... how it plays, and this will take some beating. The individual events don\u2019t strike you as top quality when you open it (thin non plasticised cards, board pieces a little shirt on detail, minis not highest quality although still nice, standees instead of monster minis, ringbound missions, etc..) even though there are some very nice touches with regards to artwork. HOWEVER, when you actually put it all together it does begin to look good and when you consider sheer volume of components you are getting great value and actually the functionality of things like ringbound book kick in when you get to playing it (a card front and back cover wouldn\u2019t have gone astray and I actually got a stationers to add an acetate cover to protect it). A lot of people knocked the standees but actually I really like them, then again I\u2019m old and remember them being the norm  xand not as good a standard as these, if anything I don\u2019t even think the minis for characters were necessary anc standees would\u2019ve worked for them. Maybe down the line there maybe a deluxe version or second edition that changes this, but having played it it doesn\u2019t need it.     It\u2019s a bit like video games. The PS4 might be really polished, but I\u2019ve recently gone back To SNES and Megadrive games and whilst they aren\u2019t as polished, the games are quite simply more fun and a big part of that is that they were innovative rather than derivative, and actually the graphics and sound work really well for what they are. It is also like these in that it at that at times you want to throw a controller at wall at unfairness of, or some levels are repetitive, but also highly rewarding when win and has the \u2018just one more go\u2019 element and if truly is too difficult or too easy just like this you can adjust difficulty.   The ambition of this is truly what sets it apart and size of content. It\u2019s 95% there and the size of that ambition is its only let down, with some repeated elements as I said above, which really is inevitable. I have heard people complain about lack of variation however it\u2019s a dungeon crawler with all the positives and negatives of that genre. There is still More than enough here to keep you interested with character development and retirement system (which is brilliant). Maybe a few more unexpected twists and turns would\u2019ve been nice in overal story arc, but road and city events are a nice diversion.  I love it and there\u2019s enough content to keep going forever and a day especially with the removable sticker sheet add on.  Maybe eventually I\u2019ll tire of it but that\u2019s not going to be any time soon. Emmersive is how I\u2019d describe it and it\u2019s a truly astonishing piece of work and truly deserving of its top spot placing. Been playing it as a mix of solo and two player and great as both. Can\u2019t recommends it highly enough, but you WILL need an organiser. I recommend the Daedalus one, think adds to aesthetic of game and functionally the best out of ones I tried.  Well after 6 months playing I finally finished it and I can say that this game is almost perfect, the only things that stop it are that it\u2019s so huge and sprawling I kind of lost my way with it and ultimately the end wasn\u2019t as rewarding as it could\u2019ve been and as I said earlier on it\u2019s an imperfect game, but still definitely part of my top 5 favourite games and I\u2019ll be moving on to forgotten circles when it\u2019s released (I also think I\u2019ll play through thsintakingbdifferentnoptions next time)!   9\u2019mknths on I\u2019ve come back to it playing some different scenarios and closing out some personal quests. Something I\u2019d mornappreciated first until now is the character classes make it an almost entirely different game as you try to work out how to use your characters. It can feel frustrating atbfirst if you\u2019re used to a certain character, but it\u2019s a challenge that is ultimately rewarding with perseverance. The orchid doomwalker feels very tricky at moment, but interesting! Also some characters I\u2019ve bonded with (inox brute) and others not so much (Valrath sunkeeper) some I didn\u2019t like to start them grew to love, the Plague caster for instance! It\u2019s still imperfect and with slightly upgraded components (cards, boards, minis) and streamlining the campaign system this would be my perfect game. As it is I still love it and definite top 5 game (still) ", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Got the 2nd printing in December and haven't played hardly anything else since. It's been super fun building your character and unlocking new abilities and items. The game continually evolves and continues to pose a challenge. Playing mostly 2 players has been a lot of fun, though the game play and campaign progression is balanced for higher counts. We're using the Gloomhaven Helper android app on a tablet, which has sped up the game for us considerably. ", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Really looking forward to getting my own copy (in 1 week). I am playing the Brute and my friend is the Cragheart. I love the fatigue system and the multi-choice action cards. I like also that the characters play differently. Also, the multiplayer game is really good!! Having the secret objectives cards and not being able to discuss exact numbers is really neat: we sometimes end up playing sub-optimal move and that is so frustrating in a good way! I wonder if there is too much admin above 2 players. The pace is also quite slow as this is more a tactical combat game than a real dungeon crawling game. I am quite excited about the game: I can't wait to make progress into the campaign! TBH the story isn't so appealling to me but I like that you discover new locations depending on your progress: thematically everything is very sound and solid. edit: moved to 9.5 after 80 plays I never have enough.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

While 80% of my plays are solo, I've played with 7 different people in different campaigns, and taught 4 additional people.  While I enjoy competitive strategy games like Scythe and Terraforming Mars, Gloomhaven provides both strategy and a copious amount of content  in the form of a campaign setting for both solo and multiplayer. It is my favorite solo game. And this is with only half of the content unlocked.  My favorite aspect of the game is the diversity of characters, and the different feeling from playing them. I'm familiar with all of the starting classes. There are definitely one or two that I would rather not play, but my friends have an absolute blast playing. There is something for everyone, but as I have experienced, it can take a couple tries with some people.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "DoonansNDragons", "rating": "9.5", "comment": "I will probably raise this to a 10 one day, as it\u2019s just a really cool game with so many interesting parts.  The idea of a constantly evolving world that parties can drop in and out of in a board game is really cool.   The battle system is unique, and makes for a many tough decisions. It\u2019s challening, but we haven\u2019t had a character die yet (playing with oerma-death rules), so it\u2019s not unfair. We feel like we are progressing reasonably well, but after 11 games we have only retired two characters, so you still need to work toward those goals, nothing is given freely.   I would say that my only major gripe right now is with the looting system, where the treasure has often been underwealming in general, leading to a lack of excitement over finding that cool item to use.  Perhaps we haven\u2019t just found the really cool stuff yet, but it\u2019s probably the weakest system in the game for me right now.   It\u2019s a classic, anyone remotely interested in this type of game should buy it immediately.  ", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "georgebaggott", "rating": "9.5", "comment": "Finally, the co-op dungeon crawl of my dreams! My formative years included countless sessions of D&D. For years I've wanted to revisit those fond memories in the context of modern board gaming. Earlier attempts (e.g. Mage Knight, Descent, Mansions of Madness) fell completely flat with my family. In sharp contrast, and as the ultimate endorsement, they are all *loving* Gloomhaven. The depth of the combat system is unprecedented and edge-of-our-seats engaging. Videogame-esque mechanics like dropping coins and unlockable content make instant sense to my kids. The storytelling, character development, and persistent world overlays a sense of purpose and intrigue. Setup and teardown are bit of a bear and play time is on the long side for us, but thus far such imperfections have been a minor and manageable downside that we're more than happy to navigate. The biggest problem at the moment: maximum players is 4, and we can have as many as 7 who want to play.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

So... Gloomhaven. You've already heard everything you need to know about this bad boy.   Greatest game ever? Maybe...  Tons of fun? Oh yeah!  Thematically inspiring? YES!!!  Can we play right away?!? Uhh... no. Unfortunately, I have to go visit my in-laws. But I can do next weekend!  No... sorry I'm out of town on business. How about the weekend after that?  Shit... no, can't do it. It's my brother's kid's brit milah that weekend.  Damn...  ...  The biggest issue is the level of commitment involved in playing. That's no fault of the game, itself, and in fact I love how engaging it is... this game DEMANDS your attention, and it's so immersive that it'll get it. I just want to wish those of you trying to get a 4-player group together good luck... you're going to need it.  The game itself is wonderfully crafted. Yes, the miniatures are great. The scenarios are awesome, with the flavor text, and episodic storytelling. It's fun to play, and when you and your party finally kill that last monster with the last two cards of the sole surviving member's very last turn... it feels so rewarding. That's what I feel Gloomhaven does really well: rewards player's efforts and hard work.  The variety of characters/items/monsters/settings/events/quests, it all encompasses a greater game as a whole. It's as if Isaac Childres (the creator) took all these great parts of other games and thought, \"Hell, why don't I just combine them?\"  And... no dice... love it!  Gloomhaven is one of the best board games I've ever played, and whenever I'm not playing it, I wish that I was. That's all I need to say, really.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

I definitely think the fiddlyness would get to me without these upgrades. Really excellent game that I think about a lot when I'm not playing.  Update 1-12-2019:This game is a dream for 3D printers.

{"username": "Vindaxius", "rating": "9.5", "comment": "This game is great.  Tons of replayability, such a fun built in campaign full of twists and turns, unlocking new features and difficulties and units and items.  But that's most the theme and the legacy systems.  Even in an individual game, the ever depleting hand size is a little tedious especially when you're wasting rounds getting to a door after a battle, but otherwise the sets feel well balanced.  Strong cards exist but can only be used once per encounter, weaker cards can still be upgraded to have larger impacts on individual rounds of combat.  Powerful item cards that can either be used once per scenario or only periodically throughout.  The number of options available is empowering and the scenarios allow for variable difficulties depending on how powerful or greedy your team is filling.  Long thematic boardgames aren't typically something you think about playing back-to-back but with Gloomhaven it's almost hard not to set up the next scenario as soon as you finished one.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

I'm not a huge fantasy/dungeon crawl fan, so I only had moderate expectations going in...but it's really blown me away. The card system is clever and engaging, and the character progression is beautifully designed.   The big caveat is that I think this game is an all-or-nothing prospect. We've averaged about two plays (5-6 hours total) every week for the past six months, often playing several days in a row--and I think that frequency is necessary to fully experience the game. If you'd only be playing this once every couple months, I don't think it's worth it; if you have the time to really dive into the campaign, though, it's a top-notch experience.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Decagauntlet", "rating": "9.5", "comment": "It's great...it's really really really great. Seeing as it is number 1 on BGG its no surprise it's great could gush for literal hours on how the game play is fun an dynamic. But there are also some SERIOUS issues I get into below. The card choosing system keeps you constantly strategizing on which side of each card you are going to use. The combat remains tense at all times with your gradually dwindling hand and the impending fear of exhausting yourself and your resources and failing a mission.  Outside of combat is an unfolding series of events when your party is on the road or in town making your group feel unique as either anti-hero rogues or goodbois.  The quality of the cardboard and materials are top notch, all of the paper and cardboard (of which there is a TON) feels top notch and no expense was taken in making a quality product.  The sculpts are quite nice and can be painted or left bare, either way they look excellent and are made of a sturdy plastic.   Now for my gripes...of which I have more then a few. The first is a big one. The game has a LOT of sealed envelopes and boxes DO NOT OPEN THEM UNTIL INSTRUCTED!!! I have now done more then the designers in telling you about them. These books, envelopes and boxes are meant to stay sealed until special conditions in your campaign (and earlier campaigns) have been addressed. Now if I was Cephelofair I would have an insert on top of EVERYTHING ELSE that you are forced to see when opening the box warning people to not open any of this. Part of the fun of the game is discovering what is inside and I accidentally opened the character boxes when first digging into the game. While this causes no issue game play wise (unless you want ot play as one of the super cool characters you have now seen and are denied playing because you are not supposed to know whats in them. I have since forgotten the ones I have not unlocked yet but still it was a surprise that was ruined for me by not explaining earlier then PAGE 40 OF THE RULEBOOK that I am not supposed to open a large portion of the contents of the game, a habit I think most people have when receiving a new game and wanting to see all the stuff. Speaking of the rulebook... THE FUCKING RULEBOOK!!!! OH MY GOD SERIOUSLY IT IS HOT GARBAGE AND SHOULD BE ALMOST COMPLETELY IGNORED!!!!!! To explain myself I started playing the game on my own before exposing my friends to the game and after 5 hours of struggling and barely getting out of the first room (and doing so much wrong) I gave up and brought it to my friends to try and decipher the game. After another 2 hours we took the front of the books adviced and watched their tutorial online. This cleared up almost everything and made the game actually become playable.  The excellent rules are buried in the rulebook which is completely trash format wise. When you are playing almost any game even one as basic as Candyland it starts you off with a 'how to set up the game' which involves shuffling the deck and choosing what color you want. In a more advanced game like Kingdom Death: Monster the game has a mandatory and fully fledged tutorial to help you dive right into the game.  Gloomhaven however starts you off on a general overview and does not include how to setup a scenario until page 12. Whats worse is that it also does not tell you that you don't actually start in a scenario but start in town to buy VERY NECESSARY equipment and road events. There is also a lack of description for tokens and what should be used when so a lot of assumption and inference has to be used. The formatting in the book with what information it provides to a new player is extremely mismanaged and I don't think it provides a good first impression at all. My biggest recommendation is to look up the COMPANY HOSTED TUTORIAL on their website or on youtube. It is printed on the front cover which kind of implies to me that Cephelofair knows that the rulebook leaves a lot to be desired. If one thing can be garnered from this review for a prospective buyer its the rule book is bad bad BAD!!!  The next problem I have is probably a little OCD, it's the box....it's not great. The box is made of high quality cardboard as is the rest of game, and it is also a MAMMOTH!!!! It WILL stick out on shelves and looks quite nice. My LGS owner described it to me as a 'tombstone' and it is a very adequate description it's a big boi. But the problem is....it is not really enough. Gloomhaven has A LOT of cardboard, from enemies, terrain, and tokens, as well as the glut of cards (hundreds) and boxes to hold character sheets, models, maps, and the literature needed. to play. But with all of this in mind there is NO organization aids available.  The tray which is used to hold cards and many of the tokens does not include anything for enemies, terrain tiles, or even card separators for the 10's of decks needed to play properly and mishandling them and mixing things up can occur very easily. The tiles are simply thrown on top which feels...well lackluster, and all of the tokens need an almost endless supply of plastic bags in order to attempt to keep anything organized.  My friend bought me a wooden organizer which turns the awful layout into a well organized and visually attractive playset. I would 100 percent recommend any of the various third party organizers to make setting up, putting away, and actually playing much much easier. The games pieces deserve better then it is initially given and I fell for organization and preservation purposes one should definitely purchase one.  Just for an example the box is so badly setup that me and my friend had to proxy some tokens at points due to not being able to find certain pieces in a mess of cardboard. At the time we had 15 seperate baggies and not all of the pieces even punched out for fear of making more of a cardboard based mess.  TL;DR The game is amazing. I would seriously recommend it for any serious board game hobbyist and anyone who wants a unique campaign driven RPG experience. The game is very well designed but the crippling organization issues and awful rulebook bog it down in places. The persistent campaign aspect, unlockable characters, and excellent combat definitely show as making this game a joy to play but the issues I described are near unavoidable for most.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Lots of customization available for your characters between ability cards, combat deck and items so every character you make is unique. I truly feel like I am playing an MMORPG in a board game form. Bookkeeping is a gongshow and even more so if you don't use an app or have an organizer/custom insert (both of which I strongly recommend).

At it's heart is a solid tactical miniatures game, with a unique card play mechanic that is sort of a simplified version of Mage Knight. The legacy aspects make the campaign a bit deeper... but most people will be put of by the price and size. I bought it on a whim - I had the cash and it was on the shelf. Nearly instant buyers regret as I drove home.  Then, I opened it up. Looked at the campaign book. The terrain tiles. The miniatures. The stacks of cards and token sheets. The amount of characters available, complete with miniatures! When compared to one of the hobbyist mainstream  big-box tactical strategy games (Imperial Assault? Descent?) there is huge value here. To reach this level of content, I would have to buy 250-350 dollars worth of Imperial Assault stuff. 140 bucks is a lot on a single game - but there are nearly 2 years worth of weekly game sessions in this box.

The combat feels great, regardless of whose turn it is. The scenarios are just outright fun to watch play out. I can't think of any way the combat system could be better; it's just so tight, tense, and alive feeling.  That said, so far I'm not all that impressed with the storytelling aspect of the game. I find the road/town events a little one-dimensional and \"the right choice\" seems pretty obvious. The story itself hasn't done much for me either, other than the sly, quippy writing. I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt that I just haven't played enough of the game to appreciate yet (only 6 scenarios in).

Way exceeded expectations and wife liked it as well.  Learning how to manage the cards and play strategically as a group is very enjoyable as well as the usual draw to continue to play to develop your character.  Looking forward to playing as often as possible and seeing if it continues to hold everyone's attention. One problem we have had so far is the scenarios taking too long (5 hours). We will have to reduce that time significantly in order to be able to play it on a regular basis.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Roadrunner1919", "rating": "9.5", "comment": "EDIT 18/02/2019 - Changed to a 9.5 as progressing through the game is very heavily dependent on a dedicated crew. We haven't tabled it in 2 months thanks to trouble organising a full session.  _________________________________________  Probably the best board game I've played. Hadn't played a fully co-op game before this, so was pleasantly surprised at the dynamics. Works best at 3p, seems easy at 2p, and takes a lot longer at 4p.  Pros -   1) Keeps you invested for way longer than other board games - I'm expecting a good two years before I tire of this game 2)The concept of unlockables is brilliant and keeps the enthusiasm levels high. 3) Every scenario is different (we are just 10 scenarios in), and every monster type adds a new dimension to the game 4) No dice rolls. The random luck elements are restricted to certain card events and attack modifiers 5) Players get to customize their characters and develop them the way they want to. Further, each character is unique, so meshing different playstyles is an integral aspect to the game  Cons -   1) Takes too long to set up and pack up 2) Storage. Need a good organiser or a 3D printer if you want to store all the pieces carefully 3) Tracking damages and monster HP's can be tedious, but we've solved that problem using apps on the side to reduce downtime 4) Need a dedicated crew  All in all, I think that the pros totally make up for the cons and this is a game worth its price and weight.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "BadgerGatan", "rating": "9.5", "comment": "Gloomhaven is an exceptional legacy game which forces extremely tight decision making with incredibly engaging mechanics. The tradeoff between strength and endurance make for a unique experience that I look forward to every week.  The class balancing mechanisms ensure that, over the course of the campaign, players have the opportunity to try a variety of play styles. Even a given class can shift between damage mitigation options, damage-dealing, and support roles depending on party compositions and personal mood. While there are certainly situations which make the play styles feel constricted, the strategy generally encourages creativity and rewards players for actively seeking ways to benefit from class synergies.  Difficulty is managed very poorly. Increasing monster stats feels un-interesting, but Gloomhaven is not a game that is fun to lose. The threat should be present, as easy sessions are also boring and slow/tedious, but actually losing is rarely a gratifying experience.   \"Kill all enemies\" scenarios can get monotonous, but they feel necessary to make the non-extermination scenarios more engaging. Within scenarios, the progression system encourages players to skirt the line of selfishness and group compassion, as loot cannot be shared or transferred and is necessary to increase character power.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

With 2 players, this is easily tiring. A refinement of responsibilities did assist with this issue in both time and smoothness of play. But it didn't resolve the issue entirely and discourages my husband from playing this game and instead picking up a more simple, less involved game.   I love the: character interaction, development, \"open-world\", rewards, and mechanics as it's unmatched in my current collection. Games average 1.5 - 2 hours per scenario for 2 players. It definitely has a high replay value and is well worth the KS investment.   Due to my husband's rough game play experience the first few scenarios, I may end up playing this solo.

{"username": "javitowildchild", "rating": "9.5", "comment": "Aunque suelo dar opini\u00f3n a partir de las 10 partidas...con gloomhaven es diferente. Creo que con 13 a la hora de escribir este comentario solo he rascado la superficie de lo que puede ofrecer. Lo que si puedo es dar unas primeras impresiones: Para mi, lo mejor es la sensaci\u00f3n constante de crecimiento que te da el juego. Subidas de nivel, a\u00f1adir perks al mazo, nuevos objetos... cada partida que juegas eres mejor que en la anterior y casi sin darte cuenta. Cada escenario, siendo parecidos, tiene \"truco\" y es f\u00e1cil fallar uno para volver  a jugarlo y que sea un paseo porque entiendes el puzzle. Que tal puerta no hay que abrirla hasta tal punto o que la mec\u00e1nica del boss te penaliza si haces tal cosa. En resumen, un mastodonte, un juego enorme y complejo que se me antoja infinito. Veremos que tal le van sentando las partidas y c\u00f3mo funciona la mec\u00e1nica de jubilar pj's. De momento un 9.5 muy s\u00f3lido que puede perfectamente llegar la perfecci\u00f3n del 10 si las sensaciones se mantienen tras seguir jugando. ", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "kossowankenobi", "rating": "9.3", "comment": "Ok, so this is a long campaign-driven game so after 3 scenarios it's hard to be completely objective.  But this is everything I could want from dungeon crawl.  It's tactically puzzly without being a grind. The core action card mechanic is a deliciously difficult puzzle and asymmetric as shit (people still wrapping their head around \"class builds\"). The campaign is simple and tidy with A STICKERED MAP (so good!). The pacing is quick enough that you're not trapped in a session for 4 hours (good bye, Descent 1.0).  The value for money is ludicrous. Isaac could have made a series of expansions and hooked people on his crack for years. He didn't. He built a passion project and shared it all for a generous amount.  If you like dungeon crawls, you owe it to yourself to try this game (although it has euro sensibilities, Ameritrashy ones). I just hope we have enough time to complete the main plot.  A true accomplishment in board games.  Aug '17 update: 35 plays in, halfway through campaign. Game is starting to wear on me, the narrative isn't strong or streamlined enough to drive you to play more. The main driver to keep going is unlocking new classes. However, you have no control over that as objectives are random so you can get \"trapped\" playing classes you don't want. May suffer the Seafall fate of \"abandoned halfway through and unpacked out of curiosity\". Possibly made too large, and we should have staggered the fun into xpacs.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "FuriousBroccoli", "rating": "9.3", "comment": "I love the feeling of staring at a long term fantasy campaign that I don't have to DM.  After 2x through the first scenario I'm looking forward to jumping in with a regular group.  The combat is interesting and tactical so far, though it seems like the 'low luck' variant is essential, at least in a 2p party.  Progression might be on the slow side.  The amount of content in the box is generous to say the least. That box is ridiculously big!   The packaging is smart and intriguing; really interested to start unlocking stuff and making campaign decisions. ++++++9 Three scenarios down in a 4p party and we are all having a blast.  Leveling up is satisfying but I would have preferred leveling every other scenario instead of every third. ++++++9.3 Playing weekly for about 6 month - retired 5 characters so we are definitely engaged.  The classes are deep and the scenario design has remained interesting and challenging.  Looking forward to next Gloom night! ++++++9.5 Still playing weekly :p ++++++9.7 Finished the game after playing mostly weekly for about 2 years.  Fun group made a big difference.  Major flaws: Monster AI is incredibly clunky and fiddly.  The game can't really make up it's mind between resolving ambiguity in player favor or against.  We never stopped getting a lot of rules wrong bc of the inconsistency.  The shuffling mechanic pops up way too frequently for no good reason - it's just a time sink.  The balance isn't nearly so tight that changing any of these would matter.  The story is light and doesn't follow much due to how non-linear the content is.  Some characters aren't much fun compared to others, but maybe that's bc those are just very interesting.  Really a lot of this is nitpicky since the game does so much right, but it does speak to an opportunity for a much improved version of the game.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Lezer", "rating": "9.3", "comment": "Gloomhaven is a Euro style co-operative dungeon crawler with some legacy aspects. The content in this game is monstrous and makes it so fun to play because you always want to discover more! The gameplay is well designed with the double actions cards. The character classes are very original and offers great variable player powers. It is so fun to customize your characters and see them becoming more and more powerful as the game progresses. I like how you can custom difficulties and that reward values are according to the scenario level you play. The game is hard and it feels more rewarding in that sense when you finally complete a scenario you tried a couple of times. Set-up and tear down is a real downside to this game and this is why it doesn't see the table very often now.

{"username": "Qwirk", "rating": "9", "comment": "I have been looking for a dungeon crawl for a long time, but suspect that I wouldn't enjoy the dice chucking involved in an awful lot of existing dungeon crawls.  This one looks interesting. The designer has given some thought to the presentation of female characters (important to me) - though the ones he has decided on may not all be exactly as I would have hoped.  The fighting is not done with dice - and looks like it would be an interesting puzzle to solve.  And then there is an element of exploration (plus the whole legacy thing) which looks like something I would enjoy. Very curious about this one! -- After 1.5 games in a random scenario I am now five games into my solo three-character campaign. Absolutely love it. It does take a bit of time to set up, tear down, and somehow attempt to fit into the box again. And so far I don't think I have spent less than two hours on a scenario (minus set up and tear down). But it is a great experience. Overlooked some rules, but so far mostly things that have made it less good for the characters (the coin that slain monsters drop), so not too bad. Have already leveled up two characters, and two characters have started working on completing their personal goal - the third has not had a chance to do that yet. Great, great experience! I guess the score for the game will have to come down - I love playing it and I think a lot about it when I'm not playing it. But it is so big in most meanings of that word that I rarely manage to actually get the game to the table - recently I've never gotten further than dragging out the box, finding the party sheet and the scenario book to try and figure out where to go next, and then decide it's too much hassle and pack it all away again. When I do have the energy though, it's a lot of fun.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The way you manage your deck and play cards is a fantastic supstitute for dice. The story/missions show a lot of work into making this a big cohesive world. Really, there are only two reasons I rank this game lower: the rulebook is hard to reference and I believe there is too much dead time early in the campaign trying to earn those first few upgrades. Some level 1 heroes just aren't very good. Quite a time commitment playing the game long enough for things to get really interesting.  Update: I've spent enough time with the game to appreciate the finer details. Classes that were originally under-powered are revealing their depth.

{"username": "cbazler", "rating": "9", "comment": "First of all, this is singlehandedly and without hyperbole the most impressive and ambitious game design I've ever seen. It's almost a miracle that Childres was able to pull this off: a deep, engrossing, extremely thematic and highly replayable, legacy \"board game-RPG\" with solid, intuitive mechanics and a reasonable number of rules.   The mechanic of having your hand serve as the \"timer\" is absolutely brilliant: it's a very elegant way of both simulating exhaustion and creating tough and tense decisions for the players (do I throw away this card now for its effect or keep it to extend my life?). I also like the added \"loot\" mechanic, which adds an almost push-your-luck element to each scenario (how much time do you think you'll need?).  The only problems I've found with the game are 1) scenarios can be really, really hard to win, and (partially because of the high difficulty), 2) it takes FOREVER to retire and get to play another character. I like my Brute enough, but I'm already jonesing to try a different character type, and at the rate I'm going, that will realistically happen in 30-45 more games (which might take years). I simply don't have the time, or the desire, to play this game as much as it demands, which means my rating will rise or fall depending principally on how often I get it to the table.   Even still, it's a masterpiece. Game of the Year at minimum, and (currently ranked 192 at the time I'm writing) I'm going to go ahead and predict: by 2018, this will have ousted Pandemic: Legacy as the No. 1 rated game on BGG.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "whokan", "rating": "9", "comment": "Epic co-op fantasy skirmish modular grid movement dungeon crawl. Card driven simultaneous selection and no dice!--The Heck you say. The most interesting play comes from the player hand management of the hero action decks where you pair two action cards and perform the basic (or super) top action of one card with the lower action of the other. Deep level of tactics and rich variety of content for fresh replay. Uses the advantage system like that of D&D 5.0. Love the scalable difficulty of encounters. Fun combat modifier cards supplemented with blessings (or curses). Love the elegant rest and bleed system from expending your action cards. I like the tactical uncertainty during combat from not knowing precisely what cards your fellow heroes will play with the built in initiative system to resolve order of hero actions. Clever hero leveling system with a deck builder (thinning) aspect. The campaign has a legacy choose your own adventure path aspect as parts of world map are revealed based on the decisions of the heroes. I wish there were a better way to track wounds and effect chits than lying them next to the minis on the map. So fiddly but I can't think of a better alternative.

{"username": "drasher25", "rating": "9", "comment": "My wife and are having a very good time working our way through the campaign.  The campaign elements are very well done, definitely the best I have seen in a legacy style boardgame.  However, what keeps us comping back is that the combat system is very interesting and keeps offering to us new tactical challenges.  The combat modifier deck is a great way to add a bit of unpredictability and special effects to the fights, and it injects just the right amount of randomness.  I very much enjoy working out the puzzle of when to employ certain cards, and when to spend the one-time use cards.    However, mixed with these enjoyable thought decisions are a few choices that I find unpleasant.  I don't like having to choose before the mission which cards to exclude, nor do I like choosing which card to lose during a long rest; these are just too painful and I prefer the random selection in the short rest.  In fact, I am not crazy about the whole diminishing hand mechanism. It just doesn\u2019t feel good, and it is pretty much the one thing that keeps me from rating the game a 10.   I also love that the Kickstarter provided a \"Standees\" version of the game.  I prefer these to unpainted gray minis any day.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Finally a dungeon crawl where you decide what you will do on your turn, not just hope that the dice will let you. I love the way you make a plan, then flip the card for the monsters, and maybe you need to do something different, depending on when your teammates will act, when the monsters will act and what they will do. And you can device a new plan. The choices are yours. But there is still excitement, despite not having dice. The combat card you draw when attacking or being attacked will mostly just modify your result, but sometimes it can mean the difference between life and death.  Overall a very rewarding and tactical experience, where your fate is mostly in your own hands, and not just the whim of Lady Fortuna. The different characters play differently and monsters get their own flavor.   Can't wait to test this in a campaign setting. From my limited experience, this one comes highly recommended.

{"username": "Sydust", "rating": "9", "comment": "I was lucky enough to be among the first wave of kickstarter backers to receive their copies of Gloomhaven. It was far larger than I anticipated, and though I thought it was pretty and the gameplay was promising, I didn't expect to fall in love with it. But fall in love with it we did.  The thing to understand about this game is that it's not just a game, it's a campaign. The title of legacy is somewhat misleading. Yes the game changes as you play it, but that's because you're developing your character within a longer campaign. Folks usually think of legacy as being a game you can only play x number of times because the secret keeps you moving forward. This game has secrets and your game does change over time, but is much more similar to RPGs than to Pandemic Legacy or Seafall.  To say that there are 95 scenarios isn't doing the game justice. There are 95, yes, but in the 9 that we have played, the strategy has been different for every map. The shape of the map and the kinds of enemies dramatically changes how we strategize.  This really is a game that you have to learn how it wants you to play, and if you play it based on how you have played other dungeon crawlers, it will absolutely beat you down. It is not a game where you move forward and deal damage. It is a game of teamwork and planning. It is a game of learning not only how your character works best, but also how it works best with the other members of your team. There's long term planning as you look over the level objective and the rooms you are in, but there's also short term planning when you try to survive just that round to move forward. There's also the question of whether you risk playing a one-time card early on and limiting your number of turns, or risk spending extra turns to avoid that card. There's also strategy in building your deck. There is a limited pool of cards available to you initially, and it slowly grows. But almost every card is intriguing and valuable, and you have to build the deck that you think will work for that particular scenario. If you take the same deck in without thinking of strategy, it's a recipe for failure.  This game is hard, but it's hard because it wants you to learn it. It wants you to be clever and always look towards the next turn. And that's a big part of what makes it exciting. Knowing you have a time constraint  and knowing that you need to keep moving leads to a lot of, \"I don't see how we can win this\" halfway through scenarios, but also incredibly engrossing and tense card selections and reveals. And when you manage to, without knowing exactly what the other players are doing, pull off a combined attack or move on your last possible turn and you accomplish the goal, it's the sweetest victory. You've won and you've won together against what feels like impossible odds.  Listen, I understand the pull of being smug and hating on whatever latest thing is hyped to bits. I get it. I'm always incredibly willing to be skeptical of the latest hotness and keep my cold heart locked away. But I have never in my life gotten so excited about a game so quickly. If we didn't like it, we would honestly just sell it for tons of money. I've spent more on a game and admitted it was awful before selling it for a loss. But that's not the case with Gloomhaven, I promise. We've been waiting for something like this. It's clever and tight, engrossing and full of surprises. It's the first game we've ever left out for longer than a night. It's been an entire month! We live in an apartment and gave up our game card table and half of our living room for it.  This is the real deal. Give it a couple of sessions to learn. It rewards you for it. And I suspect that this will be rewarding me for at least a couple of years, likely longer.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Random modifiers on top of card driven strategy means you're not at the mercy of luck all the time.

Occasionally i have a brief flash of fighting tedium.  But overall it is very engaging, and the campaign and level ups are addicting.    I feel it might supplant mage knight as my #1 solo game (which i never thought would happen).  The combat and card play has a very mage knight feel to it to me, though less fiddly and less of a beat down than mage knight is.  If mage knight somehow had a campaign mode, it might keep it's top spot, but it doesn't.  It loses some rating due to being so time intensive for setup and take down, which is a real bear despite a lot of effort I put into some storage organizing. Notably worst than any game in my collection, on par with descent, which I no longer have.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

We've only played 3 scenarios, but I suspect this will be the only game we'll play for a few weeks to come (and that is downright impressive). I don't want to give it a 10/10 yet, because I want to wait to get a bit of an aftertaste of it. Update: We're like ~20 scenarios deep and we all still love it. We still have classes to unlock and all that. I'm afraid we're near the end of the campaign, but there seems like there will be a TON of user-generated content, so this game may last forever. My only gripe with this game are the map tiles; they're hard to fit into the box and hard to sort through for each set-up. Here's a 4-month later update: We're near the end of this game's lifetime even though we've only played ~50 scenarios. I think this game really suffers from too many components. We play with the app, but there's still soooo much set-up time. I'm just getting tired of all of the pieces I have to manage. 6-month update: We haven't played this game in a while. I am way too sick of the set-up time to keep playing this game. What a hassle.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Setup and fiddliness are off the charts, but it's a fun enough experience that it is tolerable. The scenarios feel fresh enough that though you end up sometimes in loops of using your cards in a certain manner, there is generally enough different that there is still good room for creativity, and the new cards you get for leveling up provide lots of different options.   Leveling provides a true sense of escalation. E.g. my cragheart starts out kind of hybrid archery/melee, but you can decide if you want to focus on one or the other more, and then REALLY bring the pain and provide great CC and tanking later. It's really just a great experience, and a well earned spot in the top 5", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The characters are unique and distinctive and gameplay feels truly co-operative.  Watching the world slowly open up and reveal more of itself after nearly every scenario is also a treat.   Every scenario so far has been a roller coaster of emotions in which we managed to snatch victory from the jaws of almost certain defeat at the last moment.  I thought games in this style needed dice to generate drama and randomness, but Gloomhaven proves that isn't the case.      Some components feel a bit too small, thin or flimsy.  The number of components seems a bit excessive (some tokens are rarely used or not used at all, and there are too many map tiles) and organizing everything is a game in itself.  The artwork is colourful, consistent and fresh.  The setting tries to be original, but often falls back on convenient fantasy cliches.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

My group and I are greatly impressed with Isaac's work, and it is clear that he is passionate in how he approaches his development process.  The only slight against this game that seems to have only been popular with a core group are the movement mechanics.  I have had 3 players quit because they did not enjoy how the exhaustion mechanic work.  Despite that, 3 of us do enjoy the puzzle aspect of the dungeon mechanics and are fine with the mechanics as is.  There is a little love it or leave it that could separate dungeon crawler enthusiasts.  ", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "dejadee", "rating": "9", "comment": "includes solo scenarios  Things you need to know going in:  - This game is a commitment. I keep it mostly set up on one table to cut down on setup time. I only play solo so far, because getting a group together is too much extra hassle to play the game. I also play one scenario over the course of several days because I can only play for about a hour at a time after work. If you want a quick, 2-hr dungeon crawl experience that you can set up and play at a game night every month or so, this is NOT the game for you. (Play Warhammer Quest Adventure Card Game instead :P)  - Tactical* combat-oriented. The bulk of this game is about card-play and dudes-on-a-map combat. There's some story elements, branching paths, etc. but it only serves to take you to the next combat scenario. And each scenario is about fighting dudes in different ways--it's not about solving puzzles, searching for items, looking for clues. The combat is the puzzle. Combat, combat, combat.  - *And it's more like Mage Knight-style combat. The focus is on cards--you play cards and to deal damage. Better card combos = more damage. Positioning on the map is somewhat important, but not as much as your typical miniatures game. There's really no such thing as cover, for instance. There are some terrain elements, but they are either traps (enter tile = bad stuff happens) or obstacles (can't enter tile unless flying or jumping). No chairs you can pick up and hurl at enemies for extra damage or pits you can make enemies fall into. It does cut down on the amount of rules you have to remember.  High points:  - Classes play very differently. Different types of build for the same class plays differently. Different enemy types actually feel different. Lots of content in the box.  - Card mechanic for combat makes for some very agonizing decisions. It also makes for a nice narrative structure. Your most powerful abilities are also usually 1-time use, so it ramps up the tension when you have to use them. You also tend to save them for the final moments of the scenario (because if you use too much of them early on, you get exhausted and lose the scenario).  - Just the right amount of randomness from the Enemy AI decks and the attack modifier decks. Not so little that games feel samey. Not so much that your strategies go out the window.  - Story tidbits where the world is slowly revealed is pretty cool. I wish the cards and the scenario books had more art on them to be really immersive. (Yes, this would make for a more expensive game....)  - Rules make thematic sense. Not of lot of rules overhead to remember when compared with games of similar complexity. I think this is because of the strict focus of the game: card-based combat. Everything else besides the cards are streamlined. Since there's no such thing as cover, ranged combat rules are easy to remember. Since there's only two terrain types, terrain rules are easy to remember.   - The \"normal\" difficulty is punishing but fair. This feels like a well-balanced, carefully play-tested game. The difficulty level is adjustable, which is a nice plus.  Low points:  - Lots and lots and lots of shuffling  - Could theoretically grind your way to victory because there is no penalty for losing scenarios, and if you lose, you still get gold and EXP. It gets tempting to grind because, due to legacy elements and the RPG-style advancement, the game is kind of like a Skinner box. You could end up replaying scenarios over and over again without any real enjoyment just for those sweet, sweet unlocks. Just don't play that way! Some self-discipline is required.  - Minimal storage provided with the game. The insert is better than nothing (like what Fantasy Flight gives you) but if you want set up to be manageable at all, you'll need to come up with your own storage solution. Many good examples for cheap on the forums. I've ended up using 1 GMT counter tray, 2 small plano type boxes, the provided insert and a bunch of baggies. Setup takes about 15 minutes. I could get it down further with some file folders and some paper CD cases, but then I might have trouble fitting everything back in the box...  - That's it! The game itself is pretty great!", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Meadweizer", "rating": "9", "comment": "Good:  Interesting characters that each look, feel, and play uniquely. You quickly become invested and want to progress with the character.   Good character advancement. After a game I was planning out the path I wanted to take for the characters.   I thought I would hate losing cards when resting, but it was actually a pretty entertaining way to time gate the game while actually making it feel like the character is becoming fatigued.   Uncovering new areas is interesting and feels rewarding.   I thought I would dislike the legacy aspect of the game, I even bought the removable stickers, but after playing it is really well done and I prefer just using the permanent ones as a memento of our accomplishments.   Enemy ai decks add a layer of unpredictability to the game which makes combat challenging. They actually have action that throws wrenches into your carefully planned turn. ie. A group turtles with retaliation 2 and you were planning on using an AoE on them.   The story is well done for a dungeon crawl. Once again you become invested in what is going to happen next and want to continue playing to find out.   Bad:  There are so many components and the rulebook is thick so it is intimidating trying to get this to the table. When breaking this out my friends immediately go, \"um... let's play something else.  Quite a bit of setup and tear down time. Ugh.   I don't care for spending cards when not in combat to move, collect treasure, and prep for the next area.   Some of the boards I received were warped, and some components were wrong.

{"username": "Stexe", "rating": "9", "comment": "Tentative rating after 2 games. The systems are interesting and this basically just kills Descent completely. Card play and customizing your character is very fun and I feel like there can be a lot of depth to the game with very few rules in comparison to other dungeon crawlers. My rating could go up or down based on the unlock packs and the overall story / character story. Either way, I'm having fun and looking forward to playing it again.  The only real negative I have with some aspects of the game are the whole looting money system. It feels weird that everyone is fighting over money and it takes additional actions to \"Loot\" or whatever. I know the game is balanced around it, but it feels like a weird decision to include. Also, the ability to replay scenarios over and over and \"grind\" XP and gold feels weird as well. I think I would have preferred a single run through without the ability to come back. Finally, the scenario book is good, but it kind of spoilers a lot of the surprise for one player who has to set it up. Unsure if the game should just be played completely open save for closed packs / flipped cards or if we actually know all the potentialities of each scenario that you'd learn from replaying something again and again.  EDIT: After 10+ plays I still enjoy the game, although I wish more scenarios had special conditions or things going on. The escort missions and loot missions and some others make it a lot more interesting and fun. Retiring is decently interesting and injects some personal story. Might downgrade the game slightly if it doesn't keep the strength in the upcoming plays, but so far it is great and fills the \"dungeon crawl\" board game part completely.  EDIT: After 30+ players the game is still fun but getting a bit repetitive. As stated before, there needs to be more special scenarios instead of just \"kill everything.\" I bumped my rating up from an 8.75 to a 9 after seeing how looting money isn't a huge deal towards the end and after making a few minor house rules that helps improve the game out.  EDIT: Finished the main game and the meta goal at 53 games (more in total since we rotated some people around). I'm unsure if it is a solid 9, but it is closer to a 9 than an 8.75 I think with some house rules to make it flow better.  The house rules I'd recommend are the following:  * After playing 1 more scenario once a character reaches level 9 a person can automatically complete their personal agenda (still have to do associated scenarios if it requires them). This stops some insane personal goals or ones that require you to replay tons of scenarios.  * Items gained from treasure chests can be given to any other party member after the scenario. This reduces the sheer randomness of getting an amazing item that simply doesn't work for your character and could have been picked up by someone else.  * Remaking your character before each scenario. In the sense that when you level up and pick a new card you're not required to only have that card, but can effectively \"re-spec\" before each scenario. This let's players fully play out a class and experience it without feeling tons of regret over picking a bad card.  There are a few other minor ones here and there, but that's the general gist of the rules I'd recommend changing just to make the game flow better.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "ND3G", "rating": "9", "comment": "A really fun game. In a lot of ways it reminds me of Mage Knight but much much much more drawn out. For some that is a good thing, for others maybe not so much.  Beating any given scenario or monster doesn't give me quite the same thrill as taking down a city or two in Mage Knight but I am glad to have them both in my collection.  I can see where it might start to feel a bit samey after a while so I wouldn't recommend playing it to the abandonment of your other games less you become burned out on it, especially if you are playing solo.   Though I view Mage Knight as a solo game that also plays well with two, maybe three, I think Gloomhaven would work best with two or three, but is also fun solo. I wouldn't recommend playing either with four.  There is a lot of upkeep and it is really easy to forget to remove a condition, slide an element icon, reshuffle a deck, etc between rounds.

{"username": "Rodge", "rating": "9", "comment": "I'll admit that we got the first edition, more as a case of FOMO (fear of missing out). We would KS way too many things back then, and picked up a few turkeys. Thankfully, Gloomhaven is not one of those.  Out of the box, it's very intimidating - there's just so much in there. We refused to even try playing it until we could get some kind of better storage solution. By the time we got the broken token solution, the 2nd edition upgrade set had arrived and we had 2 more players eager to try it - so our group \"The Fearless Four\" was born.   We've had quite a few long sessions playing Gloomhaven, and it hasn't disappointed at all. We're progressing the levels well and all really enjoying the storyline. I think that this is going to be a first choice game in our group for quite some time to come!  An incredibly solid adventure game, quite well written rules, a great story narrative. The models are amazing (what we've seen of them) and quality really just oozes out of everything in the box - you can really tell that this game was a labour of love to produce.  With the first edition, 2nd ed upgrade, broken token storage and a mountain of sleeves - this game has easily cost us \u20ac200.

{"username": "randplaty", "rating": "9", "comment": "There are definitely flaws to this game. That's why it isn't a 10. The strange thing is that it's just as fun, maybe even more fun to me than Arkham Horror LCG, which I rated a 10. But it's also about as fun as Imperial Assault, which I rated a 9. They're all tremendously fun games.  The problems first. The biggest problem to the game is setup. It takes a long time. Its not just prior to the game, it's also during the game as you reveal rooms. It takes a long time. In IA, you need to find guys and set them up, but with Gloomhaven there is also the monster decks and the monster card that you need to find among a billion other cards. That's the worst part. And I really dislike the idea of using an app to track it. It's just not as fun to do that.   It's probably related to the first problem, but for what it is, it takes a long time to play. Both IA and Arkham Horror the card game can definitely be played in under 2 hours per scenario. Gloomhaven feels so slow compared to the other games. It often takes more than 3 hours to complete a scenario for 4 people. That's rough.  Scenario design is also pretty straightforward. There are some cool mechanics with the bosses and all that, and that changes, but the actual map is static. The goals are generally the same. In IA the goals change, but there aren't the cool different mechanics. In Arkham Horror LCG, there are cool boss mechanics AND the actual scenario map will shift and change AND other different things can happen. So the scenario design is pretty meh compared to AHLCG but decent compared to everything else. So this isn't a huge negative, but it isn't a huge positive either.   Okay the positives. The cardplay is pretty fun. It's definitely not the most fun part of the game. I like eurogames, but I like Ameritrash better. So yes its fun and different. It's thinky, but it's not the standout part of the game for me. But it's definitely fun. Its fun figuring out the initiative and the positioning and how to manage the cards. That definitely adds to the game.   The game is huge. That's the biggest part that I like and that I keep coming back to. In IA, there aren't 17 different characters to unlock. There are all these different perks to add to your character. I want to find all these items and see if they're any good. I want to figure out what's going on in Gloomhaven. I want to get some global achievements. That aspect of the game is the standout part of it. 95 scenarios! That's crazy. This is what makes me think about the game more and more. I actually don't really like playing my character, the Tinkerer. But because I don't like playing him that much, I want to complete his personal quest and unlock a new character. It also feels great to add cards to the attack modifier deck. That part is cool.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Kaarukun", "rating": "9", "comment": "Favorite game so far. 4 player party with two couples. We usually play 1-3 scenarios per per month. Would like to play more but time constraints and balancing playing other board games makes it difficult. Reducing the total time by a half would help.  Pros: - Wives aren't hardcore gamers but they enjoy the game though it can be a bit on the heavy side for them due to it's puzzle-y cooperative (yet partially selfish) nature.  - Characters that stick with you and build a history/story going through the scenarios. - Rolling a desperate target-add area of attack 2x damage combo to do over 40 dmg. - Completing scenarios by the skin of our teeth that were harder than we needed to set. - Having the larger campaign that ties the scenarios has better continuity and meaning as to why we are playing them. - Fun and elegant dungeon crawling mechanics that give a sense of tension as you lose cards. - The excitement of leveling up, retiring, and opening up the 2 mini.   Cons: - Scenarios on normal/hard are on the long side with 4 players and AP prone players. Hard took us 4 hours total setup to teardown. - Forgetting to read the rules on the scenario due to the setup rush and finally realizing what we finished didn't count. - Setup time is long without everyone's help. - Lots and lots and lots of rules. Takes a few plays to realize doing many things wrong even after reading the rulebook multiple times. The FAQs help.  Things that help game running smoother: - The FAQs for first time play. - Reduced setup time using organization trays and reducing what is needed from the box. - Reduced cognitive overhead using companion tools   like gloomhaven helper to track monster hit points, action, and modifier cards.  - Having consensus beforehand on where to go next so that setup can be done before people arrive (or having a dedicated table where teardown isn't necessary) ", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "tboys", "rating": "9", "comment": "4/6/2017: Just upped my rating from 8 to 9. After the 3rd play of this game, I like it more and more. There are a lot of different game mechanics that I think work really well together, e.g. multi-use for cards (top and bottom), initiative number for turn order, card depletion, mission and character quests, character progression, and many more. The combinations of all of these make the game to be one of the best games that I have played and certainly one that deserves the rank in BGG and hype it received so far. I am glad that it is back in print again. A lot more people need to play this and be awed by the brilliance of this game! :) ___________________________________________________________ 3/2/2017: This is the second dungeon crawl game that I played.  During the first play, I used the Virmling Mindthief. This character is not as straight forward to play. It has the abilities to summon the rat to help the character, and controlling enemies, which are very different than a straight hack and slash character.  This game is certainly not the game that you can get the full grasp with only 1 play. It warrants multiple plays to fully understand your character and at the same time the character progression in skills and abilities. Additionally, the world around you also evolves with new monsters to fight and defeat. On the top of all of these, you can also change your character to a new one once you completed the character goal. This game is implemented perfectly with the legacy element.   As for the game play, it has very interesting mechanics. The game count down is done elegantly through the use of cards. So in addition to the need to understand how to best play your character, you also need to plan out your move so that you don't run out of cards before the team accomplishes the mission (i.e. killing all of the bad guys). Combination of the legacy game and the mechanic makes it a very challenging game to play.   I really can't wait to play the next scenario of the game.

I like the card play though prefer the card play in myth.

{"username": "Surge1000", "rating": "9", "comment": "Normally, big box full of dungeon crawl is not my cup of tea.  This game, however, does so much more.  It has so many more strategic elements, and the mechanics (the multi-use cards with an action selection feel and the need for serious planning regarding the order in which they are played and returned) are surprisingly deep for a game of this variety.  Yet, the game is just dripping with theme and creativity.  Also, the box is full of so much content, and the characters all have such a unique style about them.  This game is truly awe-inspiring.  A dungeon crawler in my top 25 games?  What?  Yeah, this one deserves it, even though I won't play through more than 10-20% of its content because these types of games just feel samey to me after a rather brief (but enjoyable, in this case) period.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "snoozefest", "rating": "9", "comment": "After 5 games played (doing a 2-player campaign):  A dungeon-crawl system like Descent, which I used to love way back when, but with: - a more elegant campaign system built in right from the start. You pick one of 6 characters to start the game, play for a while developing it, then eventually retire it and choose another (with more options being unlocked as you play the game). You have just one scenario to start the game, but that opens up two, and from there game paths can diverge (a lot, it seems?).  - a simpler but more interesting system for character development: as you gain experience, you can customize your combat deck and action cards - a great action card system: players have unique decks of cards each showing an initiative number, a top half, and a bottom half. Each round, everyone uses 2 (one on top); turn order set by the numbers on top. On your turn, use the top of one card, the bottom of the other. Tops are usually attacks (melee, ranged, variable additional effects or bonuses), bottoms are usually moves or special effects. You have to plan but can change your plans on the fly if necessary (in a limited way).  - a very cool AI for the monsters, once you can figure it out (I think we've almost got it!).  At this point, the only negatives I see are: 1. It's a co-op. Fortunately, gameplay is interesting enough to overcome this shortfall. 2. The rulebook is big! There's a lot to learn, a lot of nuances to grok. Fortunately it's mostly straightforward. 3. I guess it would be nice if we had the super-pretty minis like we did in Descent, but the box is already ginormous so I'm okay with standees!", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The only thing keeping me from giving Gloomhaven a 10 is the excessive amount of admin - setting everything up is a pain in the ass sometimes.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Jose-san", "rating": "9", "comment": "If I designed a dungeon crawler it would share a lot with Gloomhaven. It only needs to improve the narrative layer and the AI (different focus algorithms) to be perfect.  UPDATE: after 20 plays, I think some other mechanics could be improved upon too. Like the element infusions or the advantage/disadvantage system.  UPDATE: after 40 plays, the elemental infusions or the advantage/disadvantage system no longer bother me. The story, though, is failing to engage me, even though the setting is fine. Sometimes it's hard to make sense of the order of events.  The achievement system is underused, it should impact the narration more.  Also, some scenarios that try different winning conditions fail at balance. They are too easy choosing the right strategy, like ignoring the slower enemies and leave them behind for good.  FUNDAS: parcialmente enfundado.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

If you like heavy games with a lot of components or deep RP elements, then this is a goldmine. It's a commitment though, so if you are looking for a single session 1 shot, this is not for you. The characters are unique (both from one another and from typical fantasy settings) and the combat system creates tension every time you turn around (pick 2 and play on initiative creates a bit of fog of war despite trying to coordinate). Missions are different and your choices will come back to bite you if you aren't wise / aren't lucky / are playing gloomhaven. Character development is a major part of the game, so picking and figuring out how to play your character matters. Any class can hold its own, but you cannot expect them to play the same or the way you might expect.   Play. This. Game.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "jimmyclarke87", "rating": "9", "comment": "- Thoroughly enjoying this. - Despite the epic setup and pack-away, my friends and I are slowly getting through a campaign and really enjoying it. - The game design is absolutely stellar. Really, I can't believe that this was done by one person. It deserves its top spot. - The card play is super fun, but also has tough, important decisions.  - Levelling up and getting perks is cool. Items are also cool. But these are all just an add-on to the dungeon crawler game. If there was no levelling up, items, etc. it would still be a great game. - I struggle a bit with getting into character, as my character is supposed to be in it for the gold, however I find myself ignoring the gold to ensure success in a scenario. Playing selfishly is difficult. - Super fun, but you need the right group to play this with repeatedly, otherwise the setup might discourage the odd spur of the moment play.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "guzforster", "rating": "9", "comment": "INCREDIBLY FIDDLY game. So many effects, rules, etc - it takes about an hour to start to play without having to check the rulebook for everything you forget. I would highly recommend to use the now-official helper app, which saves a ton of time in setup, although the app itself is a bit strange and fiddly to use.  I love the puzzle aspect from the cards in your hand - that was (to me) obviously referenced by Mage Knight's similar mechanism of card playing.  The game is fun, but that fiddly aspect bogs it down considerably for me. Will play more to see what's in store.

It gives me the experience I would want from a game of D&D but actually has a tactical feel instead of just crossing your fingers and rolling your dice. This game has been BRUTAL so far (lost the first scenario twice before finally eeking it out) which isn't a negative. I want my co-ops to be hard (Of course we might just suck). I feel like this has a chance to climb as we actually get into the whole upgrading our character thing. So far most of our experience has just been with the first two scenarios. Even so, I can tell I'm going to love playing this one for a long, long time (which is good considering how long it will take to beat!)", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "pickboy87", "rating": "9", "comment": "So, it's more or less an RPG mixed with something akin to Mage Knight. While strictly easier than Mage Knight in regards to the difficult decisions, it does provide many tough choices and enemies that don't hold back. This is probably as close as you're ever going to get to an RPG in a boardgame format. It's 90ish scenarios and each takes between 2-3 hours to play. Not to mention if you fail it, you need to redo it if you want to get the extra experience or unlock the next scenario. You also have treasures that unlock more content and items that need to be looted during the exploration and completion of the scenario.  The time it takes to complete a scenario is longer than I was expecting and it'll most likely lower in the time it takes as you become more familiar with the characters. The tough choices to spend a strong attack early or to keep chipping away against the inevitable timer of your hand slowly disappearing is what keeps this game tense. Not sure how different the missions will end up being and solo is fun yet a lot to juggle.  I currently really like this game, but I'm not sure I love it yet. Maybe if I had never played an RPG before, this would be a 10, but it just feels like a cold DM out to murder the players.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "osu_bry", "rating": "9", "comment": "About 10 scenarios in, love the deck-driven combat system, love the concept of a coop where the group has an idea of what everyone is doing, but doesn't let you plan down to the impulse what you're going to do.  This both adds to the realism (and in some cases the humor) and also mitigates SOME AP.  There's still plenty of AP to go around.  The story is fun, I'm interested in my character and developing his story... my biggest gripe is that this is at the end of the day a dungeon crawl.  And if you had to bet your life on what the goal of the dungeon was going to be, go with \"Kill all of the enemies\" and you should live a long life.  I wish there was more variety in that regard but this is a hack and slash, let the bodies hit the floor kind of a game.  If that's not your thing, you're probably not going to like this as much as the rating suggests you would.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The only reason this didn't get a 10 is that the sheer size of the campaign creates an immense weight of planning if you want to have a real crack at it with a gaming group you don't live with. I've played weekly for 2-3 months with a regular group and we didn't even feel that we got past the introduction of the main story. I also know a group that plays 3 times a week and after 6-8 months only felt they were starting to close in on the end of the main story.  Must have for RPG or dungeon crawling groups that only play one game for months and can play multiple days a week. ", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The card use is so intriguing and innovative.  Just retired my character, and my new character is soooo different.  Very interested in seeing where this game goes.   One thing I don't like is that it is a beast to set up and take down.  Lots of parts and pieces, but worth it in the end.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Axel21", "rating": "9", "comment": "Gloomhaven's combat design is absolutely the best of its kind: it's simple to learn and hard to master, it's reasonably fast, and I've yet to see an ambiguous case to ever arise while playing, fiddliness is also minimal albeit setup and put down times are very long and demand a custom storage solution.   The way combat moves have been \"encoded\" in a simple language of numbers and few symbols is genuinely an inspiring masterpiece. And while I may not agree with the rating because I think this game bargained its soul to the number crunching devil, I still think this is a must have title in any collection, and definitely a game worth playing at least a couple of times just to enjoy what a truly solid design feels like.   Given the price it's a steal, there is a ton of content in the box, and while the quality of the components is not that good, its sheer ambition and scale makes up for it.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "turtler7", "rating": "9", "comment": "Christmas 2018.  Came highly recommended, has like 100 normal setups that all last at least an hour plus a generator to allow additional plays.  Seems to be a D&D campaign ran through a boardgame with the DM being the game itself.  Sounds amazing but will require the right group of players who can do so regularly.  I hope to get a group so this doesn't sit dauntingly for too long.  Feel free to squeeze into my group for it by force :)  My verdict: I love this as a solo game.  I am using 3 characters for my party.  It takes me like 4 hours to setup, slog through a scenario, cleanup, etc.  But I have enjoyed doing this on boring days when others couldn't come.  My first mission played with other players and a couple times I have had people play as part of my party during my main solo campaign.  Those experiences have been alright and everyone sort of liked it but were not sold on it.  It took long enough to teach them and there was too much confusion to play combat with hidden card selection so I just am not seeing the ideal situation for multiplayer in it.  But for solo, this satisfies a short term game solution for me.  I will probably burn through enough of it that things start to get repetitive soon.  But so far unlocking new characters (retired 4 of them in my first week of play after about 20 scenarios completed) has kept me interested for now.  I am trying to keep the copy in good shape and will likely trade it when I am finished milking what there is for me to enjoy from it.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Component quality is very good and you get so much \"stuff\" (which is probably why it rates so highly).

{"username": "Ka_el_em_O", "rating": "9", "comment": "After all the hype and preparing and organising all the  stuff and components the first two games felt pretty anticlimatic. Modifier decks are quite swingy, but there are nice combos to explore. 2nd printing from kickstarter, includes Solo-Campaign and character standees,  Edit: the timing mechanism is indeed quite smart and creates interesting decisions  EDIT: this game is more prone to having rules overseen than Mage Knight 0_o. In our case we forgot to collect loot and XP after failed scenarios, which made for the very unpleasant feeling at the beginning of our campaign (rating adjusted)  EDIT 2: Make sure you play this consecutively without longer breaks. The story is a little too generic so you will forget the details after weeks of not playing it. This after all is definitely a masterpiece and a unique gaming experience - the fun and crunchy hack n slash-euro hybrid gameplay and the massive amount of content are definitely a must-play/own.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "munihack75", "rating": "9", "comment": "7.0 1/17  Not wowed by it yet. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a solid game, has a lot of theme, a good system, and a ton of content. It\u2019s got some nice artwork, but not fantastic. The cardboard components feel just slightly cheap compared to a dungeon crawl with more plastic or made by a company with a little higher production values. I think the value comes from the overall impact of everything together, especially after some regular campaign play. That\u2019s where I\u2019m not sure I fit the target audience. I will likely get most of my plays solo, and while it is still enjoyable (and there is available solo material as well), it seems best with a regular group. It remains to be seen whether I will be able to fully appreciate these aspects and whether my rating will go up with further play. However, it will not likely go down. My initial impression is that I like the card management and that this will be a satisfying adventure game for most.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "dcaccavano", "rating": "9", "comment": "Wonderful wonderful game. I have been waiting and waiting for a fully engrossing dungeon crawl campaign and this is finally it. The card-based combat is incredibly rewarding and strategic. The over-arching campaign and leveling-up system is exactly what I have hoped other games would provide. The rewards feel earned and substantial. I have been playing solo with 2 characters and it is my favorite. I cannot see it leaving its spot, literally, on my table for a long time. I can't wait to bump each character up a level or enhance a card, or discover a new location. It is really good.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The only steps towards good co-op design are the secret objective cards \"just let me open the door please\" and the ridiculous \"you can only talk in character\" rule.  A co-op game needs some mechanism to keep one person from bossing the game around, and forcing them to say \"medium fast\" instead of just \"35\" is hack.    Damage Report, Space Alert, Dead of Winter, and Battlestar all added something to make everyone feel like they were playing.  This game is based on mercenaries; it could have done something with that to make player involvement more even.  But oh man, as a solo \"D&D Legacy\", I'm going to play this one for years.  It's up there with Pathfinder Card Game 1 & 3 (sorry 2, you sucked).", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Ryalyn", "rating": "9", "comment": "------ What We Liked ----- - Complex character and story progression.  Reminds me of a boardgame version of something like Skyrim.  - Detailed story elements and theme.  Feels a lot richer of an experience than some other boardgame RPGs I've played.  - Lots of strategy, choices, and planning (which we find fun)  - Lots of immersive components (which we also like)  - Other than some of the punch-outs having slightly unaligned art, the components are good quality.  Boards and tokens are sturdy.  (I cannot speak to the cards because I sleeved them all.)  - The game is graphically interesting to look at and the art is beautiful.  I'm glad that the monsters are standees because it makes the board look really nice and is easy to identify what is where.  - Once we got into the swing of the game, everything seemed to fit well and make sense to us.  ------ What We Didn't Like ------ - Takes FOREVER to set up and put away a game without a box insert.  All components are by picture and many are double-sided so it takes quite some time to sift through enemies and tiles to find what you are looking for.  All characters have to be crammed back into their boxes which (especially with sleeves) requires some tetris.  An insert is a MUST HAVE.  - The materials included in the game did not include a clear, easy way of how to get started.  I had to download a bunch of fan-made documents off the files section in BGG and watch a bunch of tutorials before I could figure out how to get started.  - Very long games when playing with people who like to think things through and plan.  We typically see about 4-6 hours per scenario.  - Scenario booklet really needs a hard or thicker cover.  The cover is the same material as the pages and since the book is so large and heavy, I'm constantly needing to be very careful not to tear the front and back pages off by accident.  - Some of the finer points to rules are hard to locate in the rulebook.  When we first got started we spent a lot of time on BGG trying to look stuff up.  We ended up making a cheat sheet for ourselves.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "nsnyder", "rating": "9", "comment": "The core mechanic of choosing the top of one card and the bottom card that also slowly exhausts and removes your character from play is absolute genius.  The tension of wanting to play an amazing ability, but realizing that it is lost after it is used adds additional importance to every decision and action.  The tension between wanting synergistic actions working with other characters, while keeping as much gold for myself as possible makes for an entirely different kind and very interesting type of tension.  This is the game I've been waiting for.  I find myself pondering about it quite a bit.  Having completed around 30 scenarios, including six side scenarios, the genius and hard work of balancing each and every scenario astounds me.  Having completed the main story line, all characters unlocked, all envelopes unlocked, and only one level of prestige to go, I have a few thoughts to add to my comments.  The game just keeps getting better.  The variety of characters, card builds, item set-ups, variety of party make-ups, all work together to make each experience unique.  Playing a Spellweaver with  a melee character is different than playing in  a group of all ranged characters.  Playing a brute with the sun class is very different than playing with the moon class despite both characters being melee.  I doubt I will ever be able to explore all possible combinations of characters/parties/items,  but I have so much fun exploring as much as possible.    The set-up time is a common complaint for this game.  I did buy an organizer, but I also enjoy organizing things.  Before our game night begins, I reorder the items and make sure everyone's character and items are ready to go.  I also prepare three scenarios ahead of time, and place the required tiles in a gallon baggie.  When a scenario is done, the tiles go back to the baggie, and I reorganize at a later time.  I try to make sure that our game time is mostly game time.  Hopefully your group has a organization freak too!", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Spazzfist", "rating": "9", "comment": "I think this game is a 9, but am honestly considering putting it ot a 10 to \"balance\" all the people who are \"balancing\" with their votes of 1!  :P  Very much enjoy this game, and I do think that it is worthy of the hype.  Dungeon crawls are a popular theme in board gaming, but this one does it so differently and so elegantly.  Coupling that with the wonderful legacy style game and the story that it weaves makes it a top game in my opinion.  The only down side is that the game can be a bit fiddly, and the need for some form of organizer in the box is essential (I use dollar store plastic divider boxes).", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The only drawback is that there is a persistent feeling that you are messing up or forgetting some nuance of the rules.

{"username": "vacuumdude", "rating": "9", "comment": "I've seen this game called a, \"GM-less D&D campaign\", a \"dungeon crawler\" and a \"Euro puzzle\". I don't think any of these is really accurate, even if it has some elements of all of them.  Instead I propose that the closest analog would Japanese strategy RPGs like Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem. Yes there is a story (and a fun one too) and yes your characters level up and gain new gear, but at its core this is a tactical combat game. And a great one at that. The card play allows for tons of possibilities without making things too AP-heavy and there's a real need to exploit the synergies of your party to win. Characters playing totally differently is nice as well. The scenario design is for the most part excellent and offers a great variety of combat challenges.  I'm not usually a fan of \"legacy\" games but I love this one because rather than taking ages to unlock rules or stuff like that, you're just thrown straight into the full game and unlock additional scenarios, classes and items as you go.

I will come back with my full thoughts after more of the campaign.  EDIT: I have now played through quite a bit of the game. The game is amazing but it needs to be said it is not for everyone. Organization is key to enjoying this game for me so being creative before you even play to make set up and tear down efficient is paramount.   I say this game isn't for everyone. I love it personally but I find the bookkeeping and tracking of things a bit cumbersome. Over all the game is creative! At times it feels really immersive and rewarding to solve the levels.  It feels like a video game and thats a good thing for me. I don't think its overrated but I do think it's just not for every person. It's a heavy game. Literally and figuratively. Know what you are getting into before you buy it. Still a 9 from me for what it does.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "skutsch", "rating": "9", "comment": "Ok, so this is a super early take on the game. I've played 1 and 1/5 solitaire scenarios (I got toasted the first scenario a few moves in and only was able to win on my 2nd go around.)   Wow, what a monster of a game. So much stuff, so many rules, so much careful meticulous planning. Well, with me in charge, semi-meticulous. My first impression is positive with a touch of \"but maybe this is just too much for me to enjoy\". Or maybe not. I like the two card combat system. It gives you a nice mix of control and random screwage. You can plan for that cool move and then some weird card pops up and you're all \"huh?\". Or, you can set things up for something that might happen, and then it DOES, and you're like COOL! (Like when I was able to toast those 2 skeletons and a bandit because they were aligned just so. Sweet.)  This game is ALL about the tactical combat card system. If you don't like that idea, you won't like the game. The combat system has a fair bit of random but the fun lies in carefully plotting things out and hoping they work, not in throwing gobs of dice like in Descent.   The flavor text is reasonably amusing but this is a plotting game first, a role playing game about thirty-third.   I'm going to keep playing and we'll see how this grows on me but I can already sense that it's likely to be a better coop game than a solo game (not true for all coops). There was stuff that happened that I wanted to share with someone, and there was just me.  EDIT April 2019 - Played my first Co-op session and had a great time. Upping this to a 9 for now. Playing with a buddy ramps up the enjoyment. (Again, if carefully plotting your tactical victory using a clever card system isn't your thing, this isn't your thing.)", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The monster AI is actually good, and challenging, while not entirely over whelming. The art is great, the minis are amazing, and I love the legacy aspect of it (though instead of ripping up pieces, we made a R.I.P bag to put in cards that we were done with, and get the removable sticker set, so if we ever decide to play again or pass on the game, its all there).   My only problem, after purchasing this beat of a game, I found that there was not room to properly store all the pieces in the box without just dumping them in and hoping I could find the pieces I needed within a reasonable time. So off to the bait and tackle section of Walmart to get some off brand Plano boxes.

{"username": "Gilnoir", "rating": "9", "comment": "Great game. The combat and action mechanism reminds me of Mage Knight for some reason even though on closer comparison, it's hard to find anything common between them. I also like the card deck for attacks which is easier to modify and expand than a system based on dice. The game also has a great strategic element to it on how the party works together and what actions people do and how do they support each other. Cragheart (level 1) for example has plenty of AoE damage attacks but cannot attack the same target multiple times. This means that for him to be at maximum efficiency the enemies have to be clustered. And to optimize this, the group has to think of initiative and movement to draw the enemies to the correct place. And this brings up another challenge as the rules forbid people to explicitly say what cards they're playing and what actions they're doing.  Overall, a very enjoyable game.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The most appealing part of this system is that it does away with the DM that you would get in descent (i dont prefer the app because electronics)and DND like systems, while also giving you a rich, anything can happen game play.   On of the most important feels that this game provides me is not only the character leveling and equipping, the amazing varied character selection legacy unlocked, but most importantly the unpredictable nature of the game, that isn't dictated by luck but more so by the sheer amount of content in the game  Cant wait to explore more.

It really does play like a D&D campaign without a DM. Sure, it's more focused on the game than the role-playing, but that's what you're here for, right?  So much of the game is so excellently clever. The simple \"choose two cards each round, resolve the top of one, bottom of the other\" mechanic works really well, and makes for a quick, streamlined game. The exhaustion system is good too; this forces interesting questions about the timing of lost cards especially.  I know some people have some (justifiable) concerns about setup and teardown time for the game, but I found that if you can play somewhere with a TV and use the app that tracks initiative order, elements, and enemy HP, it makes things much easier.

{"username": "pdallair", "rating": "9", "comment": "This game is a hobby on its own.    It takes serious financial devotion for the game itself and a storage solution.  The game cost me 140$ (CAN) and the storage solution (Custom) ended up costing me 100$+ (CAN) since I had to buy an electric tool.  Some components easily get damaged so I had to buy glue and now I need a new scenario book (protip: no drinks at the table).  It takes serious time devotion to play this game regularly as well.  A single scenario can last up to 3 hours and there are 100 of them.  Setting up the scenarios, even with a storage solution, can be pretty long as well.  It's best if you can just leave it out.  It takes some skill to get the full/intended experience of the game.  If your gamers don't know their role and/or overuse/underuse their character skills, you might have to house rule and/or lower the difficulty.  Gamers who take the time to read up on their class and rules are golden.  People often compare this to D&D but it's more like Elder Scrolls (video game).  This game does not emphasize the role-playing element like other tabletop RPGs but it does a least give you a finite number of narrative choices (or the illusion) like many video game RPGs nowadays.  That said, Gloomhaven achieves things exceptionally well.  The world building (classes, races, scenarios, environments, etc.) clearly reflect great investment by the designer(s).  Despite the finite number of choices, there are still many to chose from in the grand scheme.  Acting them and the results out (role-playing) has lead to amazing experiences.  The coop-but-not-so-coop gameplay, encouraging us to be selfish despite having to work together, can be hilarious.    \"I don't know what came over me guys but... I can't control myself..\" *steps into trap* \"The pain... It jut feels... so... god damn gooooood.\" *trembles*  The glorious critical hits and flops are quite entertaining as well, like any tabletop RPG.  If you and at least one gamer friend have a lot of free time, by all means, go ahead.  With the right people, this game deserves it's spot as #1 here on BGG.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "P.O.G.G.", "rating": "9", "comment": "Game has a few strikes against it, but ends up being so engaging and fun, that I give it a fairly high rating.  What strikes?  Well, set-up time is pretty long and progression of your character can plod along a bit as you grind for XP and Gold (one of the things I didn't like about another popular game, Pathfinder Adventure Card Game).  Storage of the pieces is also a bit of a nightmare, which is why I bought a Broken Token organiser.  Fiddling with the bits while you play is also a bit tedious but I use the Gloomhaven Helper App which tracks a lot of the more fiddly stuff for you.  Like I said though, the game is very fun and engaging.  I've played 31 times so far and I'm looking for more.  My favorite player count is 3, since with 4 it bogs down a little and becomes a little chaotic.  Playing solo with 2 characters also works well.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Wstippel", "rating": "9", "comment": "Don't let the price fool you. It's pretty expensive. But what you don't know is that if you can manage to find this game at a good price (about $114) you then have to compromise on either spending an hour or more to set the game up or spend about another $20ish to organize it. Or about 80 if you buy an organizer.  So...why the great reviews? Because it's fun. And to risk sounding like the great Dr. Seuss it's fun alone, it's fun with friends, it's fun at night and first thing in the morning. You can play it all day, you can play just once, you can keep it all out and play for a month.   But really though, having a game that requires no luck, has an absolute ton of content, encourages you to keep playing and kind of feels like a video game adaptation of a board game makes it easy to forget about that second mortgage you pulled on your home to own it.  Sure, you can say there's games that cost just as much or more (*cough* twighlight imperium *cough* shadows of brimstone*) but they most likely don't have the same amount of content out of the box or you can't play them with just 1 or 2 people.

{"username": "cimorthing", "rating": "9", "comment": "Now that I've been playing for a few weeks, I LOVE playing Gloomhaven. I have been craving this kind of Legacy, Role Playing, Cooperative game my whole LIFE. The mystery, the unlockables, the random events, the infinite possibilities, the suspense about what's going to be in the next room, the hilarious experiences in each scenario in the campaign makes this game one of a kind. I LOVE being able to customize my character to fit my playstyle and smashing through a room absolutely FULL of repopulating enemies and emerging somehow victorious one turn from exhaustion.   My husband and I enjoy playing table-top games--especially cooperative games, and when we first got our hands on Gloomhaven (2nd print), we were positively ecstatic. We obsessed over our characters and our cards and monster movement--reading and rereading the rule book and forums.   Then we actually played, and I'll be honest, the very beginning scenarios were the OPPOSITE of an enjoyable experience. Not because everything wasn't beautiful and full of mystery and excitement, but because (even though we had read the rule-book multiple times) we had NO CLUE what we were doing.  We struggled. Like, SERIOUSLY struggled. There may have been some tears, wild angry outbursts, and 3-4 hours of constant frustratingly tense indecisiveness.  And not just the first game, the first FEW GAMES. Nothing like failing a game so miserably that you start to dread pulling the game out ever again--especially after anticipating it for MONTHS!  For us at least, including a lower level tutorial game or two (as an optional prerequisite)  would have allowed us to understand our character's movements, attacks, and team card synergy as well as practicing monster movement--and STILL feel like we were involved in our role-playing campaign adventure (like the beginning of any video game) without making us feel like we were character switching, level-zero LOSERS with crippling card play anxiety.  THAT BEING SAID, once we figured out how our characters worked together, and laughingly learned how to play in the air of almost certain defeat; we started having a BLAST. (Note: We also ditched Cragheart/Scoundrel combo for Brute/Scoundrel combo)  Role playing as our characters encountered hilariously unfortunate events, enemies populating out of control, and unfortunate nulls drawn at a critical point in the game--and STILL managing to scrape a win ONE TURN from exhaustion has lead to nail-biting but exhilarating experiences that we have immensely enjoyed over the past two weeks of nightly gameplay--and will probably continue enjoying for months!  And to think we almost shelved it!", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "the_lifetamer", "rating": "9", "comment": "The Fantasy Adventure game that sets the bar for all comparisons. A product of love and inspiration that dared to aim higher that any of its predecessors and broke a series of thresholds as it hit its marks to the surprise of most.  The Pros:  1)It's so epic that it will redifine the word for you.  2)Amazing monster and player class variability.  3)Amazing in-class replayability.  4)Solid mission design.  5)A fully fledged world that will seep into your adventure one mission/event at a time. It's high fantasy but believable.  6)Great gameplay with an amazing hand management system that is both simple to play and difficult to master.  7)Pure co-op with an amazing AI (the best I've seen so far) that allows you to predict it just as much you should... most of the time, and more as you get more experience with each particular enemy.  The Cons:  1)The futility of the level up design is more profound in such a long campaign. From a point on you simply realise your level doesn't matter (other than giving you more options), as the monsters level up with you. 2)The fatigue mechanism is generally solid after a few games, but it's still very anticlimactic and can feel like a real bummer for new players as they won't realize until too late that they need to conserve their strength/cards. 3)Losing a mission nets you benefits in the long term!, as you keep any gold/xp and get to replay it as many times as you need. There's a clear design hole here. 4)The retirement mechanism is interesting, and the upgrade (cards) mechanism absolutely fantastic, but one kind of kills the other. 5)The game is difficult to store it its box, and that has a side effect of increasing set up time until you get a storage solution. 6)I don't really like the loot system, and it's difficult to explain thematically why the heroes don't just loot the area clean after they win. This hurts more once you realize gold is what gives you an edge in battle. 7)The components are lacking in artwork. The boards are plain, the player cards have no artwork at all and the summons get a generic token that isn't even practical. The only exception are the monsters that have great artwork, and the items that are fine. 8)The gameplay is fairly prone to analysis-paralysis especially while you learn a class.  The game is a blast to play. None of its flaws is fatal, and each of its strong points is mindblowingly well achieved. ", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "katiedz", "rating": "9", "comment": "This game is very well designed and immensely fun. At first we were a bit discouraged having lost the first scenario because we were thinking the game would be too hard. It just took us playing it once to better understand how to use our characters. Since then we have played 5 more scenarios and haven't lost once, and we even upped the difficulty level. It feels more like a video game to me than a board game in the sense that when you complete a scenario, it feels satisfying to have progressed, and to have learned more about the story, and I can't wait to come back to see what happens next.  Have only played it 2 player so far but we are looking forward to adding a few players for a scenario or two. Everyone's comments have been correct- setup does take a while and the plano box storage solution has made this a lot quicker and easier. We leave the game out on a table in our house rather than packing it away between games.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "StuartDM", "rating": "9", "comment": "The complexity and enormity of what Gloomhaven is trying to achieve is admirable - and they almost pull it all off. As a four player board game with roleplaying and really strong legacy aspects it is unsurpassed. The balance and depth to the many character classes are exceptional. Having played for almost a year now (just over half way through) I would acknowledge it lets itself down slightly on certain random events and the repetitious nature of many (kill everything) scenarios. However that does not take away from what they have accomplished - a true 9 out of 10 game, which although it appears expensive is actually amazing value for money; due to the enormous number of hours of play in a single box. We are playing with four players,  and manage 1 to 2 games a month, with 2 or 3 scenarios a session. 12 months later we are around 30 scenarios in and have some view of the 'end' of the game.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "SkyShadow38", "rating": "9", "comment": "We've only played through the first scenario so far, but we really enjoy it. It kind of has a bit of a modern HeroQuest feel to it. The individual characters sheets and the perks and cards that you can unlock later have us itching to play through more scenarios to see where our characters will end up. And while there is a lot of iconography to get used to, overall the game mechanics are simple and well balanced.   Choices that you make with your cards feel like they have real weight and the game similates the tension and eventual exhaustion characters can experience in a dungeon crawl really well.   The game is a bit fiddly, and organizing it is a bear, which can make set up/put away a bit time consuming (buying an insert helps). This prevents me from giving it a perfect score, but overall with it's many, many scenarios and things to discover, the game is a great value for money and is fun to play.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "bjhenderson", "rating": "9", "comment": "At it's core Gloomhaven is a campaign based, dungeon crawl, legacy, mostly cooperative, \"RPG light\" game.  It does what it sets out to do exceptionally well.  Gloomhaven is set in a fun and flavourful fantasy setting.  The narrative elements of the game help set a light but immersive tone.  The card driven movement/combat system offers interesting decisions (it is this system that truly sets it apart from other dungeon crawls I have played).  The volume of content is impressive.  The component quality is fair for the price of the game.  In my opinion, Gloomhaven is the best dungeon crawl board game I have played.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Both the thoroughness of the design required to support 90+ scenarios and the way that the game works with 2-4 players.  We're still very early into our campaign, but already starting to sort out strategy and tactics and how the different classes fit together.  A lot of variety, a lot of interesting puzzles to solve, and a game that has a well designed internal clock that puts a lot of control in the hands of the players.  This is what dungeon-crawlers should be.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

El sistema de cartas es fant\u00e1stico, te obliga a planificar a medio plazo y a mantener un ritmo de partida ya que cada vez que tienes que recuperar las cartas pierdes una. La idea de que el grupo no es cooperativo pero tienen que ayudarse para terminar la mision tambien esta genial ya que cada uno tiene que mirar por sus agendar personales pero si no se coordina con el resto, todos van a fracasar.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "syphon", "rating": "9", "comment": "I did notice that the package it arrived in was nearly 22 pounds (in weight).  It looks like it's going to be a bear to organize.  Update: Tentative rating of 9 after playing 5 scenarios.  I want to compare it to Shadows of Brimstone. It's better than SoB in the campaign sense. There's a narrative that you're working through.  But SoB shines mid-mission. GH feels...kind of dry, and gamey while playing a scenario.  It's an interesting puzzle, make no mistake. But thematically, it doesn't match up to SoB in that sense.  Update 2: After another 5 scenarios or so, my rating stands. If anything, I'm enjoying it a little more as my characters level up and I start to make modifications to attack decks and action cards. I really like that customization aspect.  Update 3: We've finished the main campaign. Opened all but two of the character classes. I've liked it more and more as I've continued to play.  IMO, the classes tend to feel a little dry until about level 6. That's when things really seem to hit on all cylinders.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Gateside0", "rating": "9", "comment": "Great and amazing game deserving of it's title of 'DnDing without a DM'. Combat and role play mechanics absorb you into the world, while being a co-op game with hidden actions that helps prevent quarterbacking jackassery. It's a bit hard to learn all of your actions and combinations of actions at first, but once you ease yourself into your character/class and start using it effectively, the game gets even MORE fun. There's enough GAME in here to last you for years.  That being said there are a couple of (rather minor, but nagging) issues. The pop-out cardboard pieces are rather low quality (pop out the pieces towards the flat side, not the indented side to help prevent the thin, cheap paper from tearing into the piece). I haven't opened up all of the miniatures to check if this is normal, but my Brute miniature came with an awfully warped base, making it wobble in place like a rocking chair. A slight bump to the table would cause the miniature to fall over, causing much frustration. All of this is a far cry from the Fantasy Flight standard I love. The gold and item pick up mechanics being rather annoying as well. You have to end your turn or use one of your actions picking up multiple pieces of loot instead of attacking and helping your team, as well as you not being able to ever trade items or gold with other players. If we're in the same goddamn party and you need 5 gold to get a crucial item that will help you survive or do damage, how the hell am I just going to say no? Or if I have an item I don't have a use for, why can't I just hand it off to someone else? I solved this by house ruling trading into the game, but you can only ask for enough money to buy an item and equip immediately.   This is not much of a complaint as it is a warning, but when playing with 3-4 players, it's easy to have your plans completely ruined being late in the turn order. This issue is more prominent when playing characters with slower actions such as Cragheart. A large part of this game is being flexible and rolling with the punches, this isn't a game for you if you don't like that.  Even with most of this review being negative, because I'm a bit of a pessimist, you know the game is something special when I'm still giving it a 9/10. Although I'd urge you to be patient, as the prices they're going for at the moment are just way too insane.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

This game is a MUST and it deserves is #1 rank.  Everything about it is great and you will quickly get addicted to it.  The only negative points are the box/storage and the components quality.  Not the best I've seen, but good enough if you take care of your game.  But the number of components is outstanding.

{"username": "pmartin89", "rating": "9", "comment": "I've spent my whole life putting way too many hours into more RPG video games than I could list. I also played some D&D as a kid. Gloomhaven perfectly melds elements from my favorite RPGs and makes them into a rad multiplayer gaming experience.  There are only a couple of things holding this back from being a perfect gaming experience for me.  I'm someone who really likes to explore every nook and cranny of dungeons in games - killing every monster and collecting every piece of loot. Unfortunately, you are constantly racing the clock in this game so that isn't really possible.   I also don't like that this is a multiplayer game that doesn't really encourage teamwork, though I guess that could be resolved via house rules. I don't like that, by default, you're not supposed to share your initiative or really what you'll be doing in great detail. It's a game centered around teamwork where everyone is centered around themselves. In a tactics game, you'd plan out what every party member is doing to maximize your party's effectiveness. Why should this be any different?  Why would I want to be the one who moves forward to open the door or activates a switch when my other two party members are going to stay back, loot, and collect gold for themselves? We're a party of mercenaries that apparently don't care about the party.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "SethroTall", "rating": "9", "comment": "Great dungeon crawler board game that is played without a GM. Enemy AI can be a bit dumb at times, but it is overall still adequately challenging.  Leveling up and the advancement that comes with it is exciting and satisfactory but remains a low enough change that power-creep is not a major problem (power-creep at mid-high levels is usually what causes our group to abandon other dungeon crawlers and RPGs) so that is a huge plus for this game.  The legacy style of gaming incorporated here is an obvious draw. As a bonus, its not damaging in a way as to make it unplayable for any future groups.  Tons of content, boatloads of characters, stacks of unlockable and lootable items and equipment, and sealed boxes and envelopes to open throughout the game. I'm excited to game every time we get back to this.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Unitoch", "rating": "9", "comment": "This game lives up to its reputation.  The actions on any given turn are incredibly interesting, as you're always balancing the need to go early with the need to set up for next turn and the need to achieve personal goals and the need to make sure you have enough cards to get through the scenario.  There's an amazing amount of depth in each character deck, which makes them each very interesting to play.  We're ~10 scenarios in, and this shows no sign of slowing interest among our group.  There are very few weak abilities, but rather ones that fit in lots of different situations.  I will admit to a healthy dose of skepticism that we will ever get through all 94 scenarios, but the legacy system has done an admirable amount of keeping things fresh thusfar.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "BoomStar51", "rating": "9", "comment": "This game is incredible, for me. I and my group do not mind great, long games. We are a group of five (though we played a couple scenarios as 4), and are therefore adding 2 to the difficulty.   I love the deck building time pressure puzzle that is each scenario. I also enjoy the legacy aspects (this is my first legacy game experience) of consistently unlocking things, and effectively having saved progress.  Things to note:  This is not really a roleplaying game. Game time and setup are definitely on the long side.    Also, this is the game that has brought me here to BGG, so maybe that's saying something.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

There are several things I could nit about that could make it better, but still, everything the game does have sets it apart from most all other games on the market.  I'd only call out that the setup time is very long and that's even when you have organization for it.  I've heard of folks using apps to help with that but I like a game without technology personally.  So be ready to sit down an hour before you start playing just to get going every time you play, and another 30 minutes to clean up after.

{"username": "DiplomaticSkeleton", "rating": "9", "comment": "Love this game.   Yes, you are doing mostly the same thing over and over. But the choices involved in the way you\u2019re doing it make it seem fresh and interesting. I\u2019m looking forward to the expansions which I\u2019ve read will be less about killing all enemies, and more about solving puzzles.   We play using Gloomhaven Helper from Esoteric Software on an iPad, so admin time is drastically cut down. We do use the included HP/XP trackers and tokens for tracking character statuses, but Gloomhaven Helper does all monster stat tracking for us. I recommend this as it makes the game playable as a four player game without admin taking over.   Organization is key for a game this size, however you do it. I use Meeple Realty\u2019s insert and am happy with it. With GH, it\u2019s better than the Broken Token one.   The story has already surprised us, and we like the choose your adventure style of the game. Unlocking new cards and perks and items is exciting, and after 13 plays our map is finally starting to look like a map!  I find myself looking forward to our next play through, and I have fun while we are playing, so I\u2019m scoring this one pretty high. This is a unique, fun and fantastic game.

The last played scenario got completed by last players last card. I really like the continuing campaign and character development, which is usually lacking in modern board games. Scenarios got a bit long with 4 players and one slow thinker, but that didn't bother too much. There seems to be a bit of a power difference between different classes, e.g Spellweaver felt underwhelming compared to lets say scoundrel. No one has died yet, so we've only tried 4 classes. All in all pretty great and unique board game. Looking forward to continue the campaign.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "awhitema", "rating": "9", "comment": "This was the first game I've owned like this. After doing a lot of research I decided to pull the trigger and get it. So far I've enjoyed it so much, and I've only barely played it. I spend all day thinking about the next time I'm going to play it. I'm pretty much hooked.  I've done 5 or 6 scenarios on the campaign so far, playing as the Brute/Tinkerer or Spellweaver. Here are some things I've noticed.  - While playing the Brute, its super easy to get yourself killed in one round, even though you have shields and start with the most health. If you don't have the Tinkerer as a companion to heal you, being the \"tank\" isn't really a great option if there are several enemies.  - The Tinkerer is great for 3 or 4 man groups, but not nearly as useful when there are only 2 people. They just have a ton of useful spells, but mostly because as a Brute/Scoundrel/Tinkerer group, we needed the heals more than anything.  - SpellWeaver is a lot of fun. I've only done one scenario (twice) with her, but she's pretty dynamic. Her just pure damage was fun to do, since I've mostly played the Brute.  Things about the game itself I've noticed.  - Like others have said, storage is pretty bad. I just went to the store and bought a few plastic containers that hold all the enemies/stands and another to hold all the rest of the cutout pieces. I used a file system to store all the map tiles, and then envelopes to store each individual enemy card and their moves. So far it's worked out great. I might grab a smaller plastic container for items like damage tokens, gold pieces, summoner tokens, etc for things that we use every game essentially. It took me a few hours to get everything organized, but I think it has saved me probably 10 minutes each setup (so roughly an hour I've saved) and that makes a lot of difference when its 2 AM and you want to do one more.  - Combat can be slow. Especially at first when you are using a new character. Not only do you have to pick your cards, but then you also have to sometimes deal with multiple enemy turns which sometimes takes a while. Movement can suck sometimes too. You never want to waste cards, but sometimes you finish a room with only one turn left before you have to rest. So you run into the next room and have to rest. Sometimes I wish that only moving while no enemies are in the room was free. Maybe that could be a house rule, but that would make the game easier towards the end of each scenario.  - The RNG due to your modifier cards can sometimes be super annoying. It's beyond frustrating to set up an attack for a few turns just to flat out miss it.  - These are the first miniatures I've ever owned, and so far they look super awesome. I managed to paint the Brute and I think he looks pretty darn good considering I've never done it before. They seem to be good quality.  There are a few more things, but this is already a long review and I don't know if I've played enough yet to really talk about them.  Ultimately, this game is super fun so far. It's been pretty addicting as it's the only thing I want to do all day. I can't stop talking about it with friends, which is probably annoying them. Anyways, if you don't have the $140 to dish out, at least find a friend who has it and play with them.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Tastya1ds", "rating": "9", "comment": "I\u00b4ll start saying that I own the Daedalus insert and hell, it\u00b4s really worth it. It speeds up the setup a lot, keeping everything at hand and well organized and it smells like burnt wood so that\u00b4s another plus.  You might be intimidated by the amount of components and stuff, but actually the manual it\u00b4s pretty well written and also there are tons of vids on youtube.  Art & Components: Everything it\u00b4s top notch, do not fear my child  Gameplay: Having to choose between top or bottom action, if you want to lose the card or save it for later, where do you move, which card 2 choose 4 initiative, everything will make you think if you want to get the most value but having taken the right decision will be very gratifying at the end. You get 2 know your character as if you raised him, like a son, from another race, from maybe another planet, from another parents.  Everything is well written and the game is challenging, the SOLO experience it\u00b4s pretty cool as well so yeah, u get a lot of value from what u paid.   The not so good stuff: if you live outside the US, it will be a pain in the ass 2 get the game, trust me, I live in El fudging Salvador so it was hard for me 2 get my hands on it, and very expensive.  Price: pricey but worth it  PS: this review might change as I continue playing the game, asof october 3rd 2018, this is a game I want 2 keep playing non stop", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "gtolsen", "rating": "9", "comment": "Some highlights, in no particular order:  ** Each character is unique at its beginning (in very cool ways), and then further grows and changes based on player actions. ** Each of the many monster types is unique too, and not just in simplistic ways. ** It's a cooperative game, and yet no player can \"bully\" other players (through personality or experience) because A) every character has its own long-term and short-term goals, and B) players are forbidden from discussing exact details of their combat plans. ** The world itself changes based on the characters' actions; it's a Legacy game.  And yet its Campaign is so very long that you don't have to worry about it ending too soon.  (And there's already an expansion pack extension in the works for 2019 called \"Forgotten Circles.\") ** Even though it's a long Campaign, changing up the players midstream if someone loses interest or you want to add a new friend (up to 4) is straightforward.  This doesn't interfere with the game balance because players are required to change characters every so often anyway, so the game is used to having characters with different levels. ** I don't much like rolling dice.  Not only does this game replace the dice with modifier decks, but it also changes the makeup of those decks throughout the gameplay, giving it so much more finesse than you'd get from dice. ** While the goal of a scenario may be \"Kill all the monsters,\" that's not the ONLY goal ever. ** The game is quite complex, and yet everything adds to the game system to make a complete whole.  After playing through it a bit, you really get a good intuitive understanding of why things are done the way they are, which helps keep your game play on track.  The biggest issues:  ** Storage.  Storage storage storage.  You can try to use the included insert, but set-up and take-down are likely to be a major waste of your time.  Either buy one of the commercially-available options or dig through the Files section here and other threads and find a custom solution you like for yourself.  (I put my own spin on the various proposed solutions and am happy with it.)  BUT when all is said and done, the printing, binder(s), plastic bin(s), etc. for a DIY setup WILL add up and will likely cost nearly as much as the commercial options.  ** The rulebook is great, but it's missing some key things like a Startup Guide and a flowchart describing the automated monster movement rules.  Find some good documents for this here in the Files section. ** Tracking monster damage and other battle effects can be tedious, and if you don't give it its proper space, this \"admin work\" can be overlooked which can trip you up.  I find that it's best if you DON'T delegate the different tasks to specific players.  Let everyone deal their own damage and infuse their own magic and it all becomes part of the action rather than bookkeeping overhead.  [Some people have tried creating apps for this, but I'm not a huge fan of that.  (Just play a video game, then -- which actually IS in the works according to the Cephalofair Games blog.  Not sure how I feel about that...)  There are some other aids available, too, like custom 3D-printed monster stands with dials for tracking HP, slots for status tokens, etc.  I haven't tried any of these yet.] ** For a game so focused on characters, it's surprising how bad the miniatures' sculpts are at recreating the excellent artwork by Alexandr Elichev.  Bottom line:  This game has SO many things going for it, and there are bandaids available for the biggest flaws (which aren't all that big).  It's an excellent game.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "ThineKlein", "rating": "9", "comment": "If you enjoy video games about fighting enemies in dungeons, then this is the game for you.  For me, part of the fun is setting up the dungeon which some people think is terrible.  I truly enjoy it.  Sometimes my husband and I will set it up before dinner and then play afterwards just to split up time.  Do prepare to spend a pretty good amount of time (~2-3 hours) reading the directions before you start playing.  We often have to consult forums online when we disagree about how something will play out in a scenario.  Some people think it is too repetitive, I disagree.  I mean of course it is repetitive in the fact that you go into a dungeon to fight enemies, but they are almost always different enemies which means they attack differently and the strategy has to be different too.  Overall a very fun, and sometimes frustrating, cooperative card game.  We have never done an RPG before, so I feel this is a good intro to that.  However, I will agree that it sucks that there is no organizer for this game, but have no fear! I am providing a link that I found that has completely changed game play.  Best part is it only cost like $30 or so for 4 tackleboxes that fit back into the original Gloomhaven box!  Score!  And someone typed up a organizer you can tape into the tackleboxes.  It is glorious.   https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1726878/yss-yet-another-storage-solution", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "TheRevelator", "rating": "9", "comment": "Now rating after completing Scenario 4: This game is great. It's super tactical, and things go wrong (or fantastically right) all the time. The game has great High's and Low's and is tense up until the very end. It has A LOT of admin and upkeep though, and you're guaranteed to forget some weird little rules interaction or ability that the monsters have, but you roll with the punches and move on because the game never feels slow or bogged down. It just works, despite all odds. I'll reevaluate my rating again after playing a few more scenarios, but even now after a short amount of time, I just can't stop thinking about this game!", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

This was a genius way to wrap initiative, powers/abilities, and health all into one.

The \"hype\" matches the initial experience--well balanced gameplay (enemies difficult enough to cause despair, characters just strong enough to pull it out), interesting non-traditional fantasy characters/races (played the Vermling Mindthief, know the Craghart is different--didn't spend enough time looking at each and every class), strong puzzles, enemies move less than robotically but more than random with use of a monster helper and create a pretty dynamic experience, and combat that leaves you feeling powerful even at a low level but just limited enough to not want to wait until the next session. It's a very well thought out game from a play perspective.  I look forward to playing more sessions, though I worry about how \"same-y\" this could end up feeling--enter dungeon, fight monsters, pick-up loot, back to town, manage inventory, repeat. Considering that and the fact that I would need to buy/build an organizer to get the game out efficiently, how quickly the game plays when multiple people are making the decisions for each character, and how assigning management of each aspect of the game to the various people, this seems like A LOT for someone to manage solo. Doesn't mean it couldn't be done, and likely there are tools out there that make this way more manageable, but it seems a bit unwieldy at the moment. Plus if I sell, I could pick up something that would get to the table a bit more frequently with less hassle... Plus, with way more copies of this being in print now, if I wanted to get another copy it wouldn't be much of a struggle down the road...  Decisions, decisions.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

But as an overall it's an amazing game, love the refreshing mechanics very much because for the very first time in a deckbuilding game, I don't require to shuffle my cards and get to pick my specific actions. It's also thematically brilliant whereby the more actions (cards) you perform in the game, the faster you get exhausted (when you run out of cards). Love the wanderlust aspect as well whereby you get to pick and choose to explore the map - very thematically appropriate for this kind of game. I also love how decision making impact the game whereby you can choose to advance with lots of good reputation or create chaos with bad reputation. ", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Gameplay is a puzzle, but not overtly complex, and scenarios are relatively short at about two hours last played (compared to Descent which is baseline close to 4). There are some rules which I have to constantly re-refer to, and set up is pretty lengthy and painstaking. But when you play 1 scenario, it's not too bad, and you can play with the Gloomy app, which takes a lot of cards off your table. Overall, great game, and am enjoying playing it thoroughly.

The yawning beast of cardboard and cards and a million fiddly parts and pieces that you\u2019ve heard about?  It\u2019s all true.  All of it.   The crazy overhead, the mess of bits, the labyrinth of rules and exceptions and it IS so much work.  But as of today, following 2.5 plays of the same scenario with the same characters (2 different parties), and all I can say is everything is worth it.    When I\u2019ve only hit the first 2 inches of the iceberg, and I\u2019ve already had a half dozen high-five moments and a half dozen panic moments, then I\u2019m reasonably sure that this creation (which is absolutely the right word for Gloomhaven) is generational.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "brothervm", "rating": "9", "comment": "Oooh... picked it up and will play my first game this weekend. I hope it lives up to the hype! First weekend was rough. I'm a fan of deep games, but this took a long time (7 hours) to set up, get our bearings, and complete the first campaign (which we failed). We had several issues with understanding the setup - much of the rulebook is set up very well, but some parts, including the setup, were a little hazy and lost in the sheer volume of rules. Ordinarily, I would do a lot of watching of videos before, but I didn't want to watch any spoilers. Still, the first campaign was fun if a bit drawn out because we were constantly looking up clarifications - planning on redoing the first campaign next play session. 7.7 for an initial rating, but I'm almost certain that will rise as we become more familiar with the game and can speed through setup and campaigning.  Replayed first campaign and it went a lot smoother, though there were still some minor things we did wrong upon further inspection. Upped rating to 8 now that I'm more comfortable/familiar with the game. Really hoping to dig into the story now.  7 campaigns in and this game is a huge hit with my play group; even one who does not enjoy board games at all can't wait to play the next scenario. Upping to 8.5.  Nearly 30 scenarios in and there have been 5 character retirements, and each new opening is sheer enjoyment.

I've barely scratched the surface with this game, and already I know I'll be enjoying the campaign for quite some time.   The hand mechanic is fantastic in that you have complete control with your selection, while still being limited in a very thematic way (character exhaustion).

This game is very admin heavy.  We started using apps and programs on a laptop, and multiple mice to help clear the clutter of monster cards, extra draw decks, etc.  We also use different stands to be able to keep track of monsters status and HP.  There are just some flow mechanics that can be improved right out of the box with replacing standees, etc.  Overall, a quality game, and I enjoy it a lot.  Just a few minor tweaks here and there and I think it would be better (for me at least).", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The world building, story and random encounters are also good and produce a fun, rich atmosphere.  I do however feel some things could have been done better. Standard scenario difficulty is high, to the point where you need to do some grinding to beat them. Also the exhaustion mechanic, while providing some interesting urgency to the game, adds yet another opportunity to fail a scenario. Finally the scenario requirements are not well explained, especially considering that there are several subtilities you need to take into account.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "jovillal", "rating": "9", "comment": "A very immersive game, and it is enormous (both regarding content and playing time), there is at least material for a year of weekly playing.  I think it is worth it for many reasons, not only its gameplay value. The miniatures are very nice, and the terrain tiles are very versatile, the monster's standees are beautiful. So, if you run an RPG game or something like it, you are getting very high added value. Gameplay is very well designed, it is impossible to drag a scenario over a certain number of turns.  The only negative issues that I can come up with are a) a language barrier (forget about playing it with someone that is not proficient in English, and b) teaching it is not an easy task, it can be overwhelming for new players, however the mechanics are easy to pick and you only need one person to have an in-depth knowledge of the rules.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "DrPowers4", "rating": "9", "comment": "I have been playing this game solo as I find it hard to get a group together often enough to ever finish this game.  I am about 1/3 of the way through and so far I love it. The game-play is great, well thought out and mostly deterministic. I don't usually enjoy games with large luck components but at the same time think that a little bit of randomness can go a long way. Gloomhaven hits the sweet spot. Turning battle modifier cards can sometimes screw up your well though out plan but it happens rarely. You can even mitigate this risk by building up your deck with perks using the excellent perks component.  At first I wanted minis for this game but now really enjoy the standees as it makes storage easier and allowed the developer to include many more enemy types with very different behaviors. This might not have been possible with minis instead of standees. A good medium would have been to include miniatures for the bosses only.  The campaign in this game is very interesting but I find it hard to trace back previous scenarios from my current scenario. Since games can occur with days or weeks in between it's hard to remember where in the story I am. It's hard to tell which scenario came before and I started jotting notes to keep track of this myself. I think it would have been helpful to note which scenarios are side missions, which are for the main story line and which are looted scenarios. Perhaps add a note for each scenario as to where it was linked FROM in addition to where it links TO.  I also found it very necessary to come up with some sort of storage solution for this game. I use the broken token storage due to it's ability to store the expansion (if I ever get to the point where I'm ready to buy that). Many of the tokens are printed on the back of others and it is still hard to find tokens that are printed on the backs of others. I can't imagine bringing this to the table without an organizer of some sort. I also use an file folio to store all of the map tiles.  This is my first dungeon crawler/campaign game and I'm inspired to try others.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "maphew", "rating": "9", "comment": "This is my favorite game, a great game for couples. My wife and I are probably over 80 sessions deep. We love playing and learning new characters. We love the hard scenarios we have to loose over and over again before winning. We've completed the main campaign and our on our way through Forgotten Circles.   But the story is just too inconsequential. We don't open this box for the story, we open it because we like the game play. The non-linear story idea floats dead in the water for me. I would prefer shorter, more straight forward stories that all take place in the same world. Often, we pick a scenario, flip to it, and have no idea how we got there, what we're doing, and what we're suppose to want. Even if we knew, our characters, whose boxes we just started a couple of sessions back would have no idea. Too little continuity. Too sprawling. I doubt I will ever play a board game as much as I've played this one again. But if I do, and if the story and writing are also good, that game will get my perfect score.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

I have a weekly group and that is the best way for me to enjoy this game. I wouldn't recommend this game to everyone but I think it is a great game. I only don't mind the set up because one of the guys in my group does most of it with me now and we use it as our catch up time, otherwise it would deter me from ever wanting to get the game out to play it. Also the insert sucks and having a custom insert is mandatory IMO, without the insert the set up time would be even worse.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

There's also a lot wrong.  The writing is lackluster and there are a lot of finicky rules and bits that could have been simplified and streamlined away.  The scenarios could have been more cleverly designed, and some of the characters are underpowered or less fun. As good as Gloomhaven is, it's clear that a revision, or another similar game, could be significantly better, and a bit more approachable for groups that are not completely hardcore.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Lighthorse6", "rating": "9", "comment": "Excellent change of pace for RPG dungeon crawlers.  Genre changing card play and format the reveals characters and aspects of the campaign.  Components and artwork are not as good as something from FFG (like Descent 2nd), but still good enough to play. It is difficult to stay focused during a long campaign.  We've been playing the same campaign for over a year and I've had to create a mission flow-chart along with unlocks to maintain our bearings from week to week.   Recommend purchasing the reusable stickers.  As a playing tip, when you encounter a decision that your party has to make on event cards, answer them from the designers' European perspective rather than an American perspective - You will have better luck coming up with the most beneficial results for your party.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "nitorita", "rating": "9", "comment": "Has a bit of a learning curve because of all the elements involved, but you'll eventually figure it out after a fair amount of time. You will likely catch yourself asking many questions online in regards to rulings, because of how complex the battle system is.  The game is best enjoyed solo since you can play it at your own pace and do things quickly, although there are some balancing issues for solo play. The box states that the game lasts about 1-2 hours, but that is misleading.  The game is broken down into two game modes: Scenarios and Campaign. The Campaign mode is so massive that it would easily take upwards of 500 hours to complete. A single scenario takes about 1-2 hours per attempt, and if you don't beat it, you have to keep trying.  Overall, the game is really nice and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a full-fledged RPG in board game format. It feels amazing to play it.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Understanding the game rules is quite difficult, but having it played is a really a remarkable experience. Do you now another board game in which one of the main characters may retire?  You get a ton of material and many, many hours of play time for your money. Considering how expensive a visit in the cinema is, this game will offer you much more value. But be warned! With about 9 kg it is a really heavy game and you won't carry it with you if you doesn't need it.  I revert one star for having a one-time experience.

{"username": "Lagomorph", "rating": "8.9", "comment": "Surprisingly challenging tactical combat game with meta (legacy) RPG elements.   While a co-op game, hidden objectives and competition over gold drops, loot chests, and experience give the game a competitive edge.   While the lore is, in general, creative and interesting, the art is pretty amateurish. Even worse, despite the sky-high price tag, there is no art at all on the combat/ability card decks, nor the storytelling decks of city and road cards.   The components, too, are not of especially high quality or polish - the HP/Experience dials spin freely, which means if you pick up your dial the wrong way, you might lose track of your Exp! One of the dials was also heavily creased down the middle, the cardboard enemies did not correctly fit inside the plastic standeeds, causing damage.   After one game, I was disappointed to find that there was no progression whatsoever - we hadn't earned enough experience or gold to do anything, and the loot box we opened contained only an \"unlocked\" future scenario...  Despite all of those complaints, the game itself was thrilling and deeply interesting in the challenge. The emergent teamwork was also a treat.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

I made something like a 200% return on the Kickstarter cost, selling my unopened copy only weeks before the second printing opened up.   That said: the gameplay itself is grand. The game seamlessly goes from large board map growth in the Legacy style... to Final Fantasy-style descending into combat with turns and a grid map. The storylines intersect and cross paths; and the characters have randomly-assigned goals and motivations, so it isn't even a case of choosing your own character-adventure. You get to unlock and unfold the existing stories, and the order of activities is not vital. A great game, I hope to someday pick up a copy at retail when I have a consistent gaming group, and just dive in.  (Written on 12/27/17)", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "rws2029", "rating": "8.7", "comment": "The iconography and layout of the information on the cards is problematic. For example, why is the icon for normal movement boots with wings? Wings indicate flight, so the natural inclination is to read that icon as bestowing flight but you would be wrong. So how, you might ask, is flight indicated? With wings of course! But wings for flight are in addition to the wings on the boots. There are many examples of inconsistent, misleading information layout, but I forgive these little nuisances because the game is just so damn good. We have completed the campaign, which is unprecedented for our group, but we still play. After over a hundred plays the game continues to fascinate. ", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

In a our introductory games, as a Brute, the game seemed to be straight forward and our party of 3 worked well together. I like the way it's possible to tweak the difficulty to various tastes.  Starting our 4 player campaign, proved difficult, especially as players concerntrated on achieveing personal objectives over group cohesion on a more difficult setting.  Which made for some fun role playing and led to our first run of failed missions.  This feels like D&D in a box now with folded space insert", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}
{"username": "hstanley", "rating": "8.6", "comment": "Upgraded rating to 8.4.  Played 5 games scenarios so far.  Fiddly as hell, giant PITA to set up and nearly impossible to store.  But a great game.    Rated an '8' more based on potential than my one play.  So, it comes the closest to reminding me of my favourite video game Dragon Age which is very exciting.  BUT to get started was so many bits to organize.  So many bits.  And so much time to figure out the rules.  So very fiddly.  It was hours before we got to play the first game and it took hours to get through the first game.    Played a 2nd game (actually the first scenario a 2nd time).  Went much better overall.  Still had to refer to the rules A.LOT.  Using the cards is both much more interesting than rolling dice, and incredibly AP inducing.  So far, I would say it has probably killed Descent for me.  We'll see how it goes over the next few plays. PS: as compared to other games, line of sight rules are a breeze and I really appreciate the designer not taking the opportunity to add a PITA factor.  Fourth game in  and its really growing on me.  Love the tension and how it feels super epic when we manage to pull off a win.  Very satisfying game.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

This game is for you if you have lots of time to analyze card combinations and are into battles and tactics.  I think a good way to describe how this game is played is a cross between Magic The Gathering, Dungeons and Dragons 4th Edition, and Mage Knight.  You need space, time to set up, and a desire to play this through.  I have had the game now for a month and I have probably sunk 30+ hours into it and I am only about 8 scenarios into it.  You also need to leave the game set up somewhere.  It is a royal PIA to put it away and take it out again.  You also should play it solitaire or with a life partner if you want to see it to completion because it will be next to impossible to get a like minded group that can dedicate the time it will take to play this game from start to finish.  This game is not for you if you cannot do what I have said is required in the last paragraph and/or if you do not like Mage Knight or MTG.  D and D 4th edition was a poor iteration of D and D in my opinion, but the battles were intense and involved like they are here.  EDIT:  5/10/19. There is a bit of an over the top worship of this game that may be pushing me a bit toward the negative side now that I have had this game for over 2 years.  Also, it is hard to find fault with a game that I have 118 recorded plays in as of this edit.  However, there are a few warts that are legit that have lowered my rating.    First, and in no order of importance, it can get frustrating to play a scenario for a couple of hours, lose, and simply have to play it again.  Many elite gamers tout that they win nearly every time and rarely have to face this issue, but I am not one of them ... I lose about 40% of the time playing solo.  It is monotonous to repeat scenarios multiple times.   Second, the story is hard to follow and not very engrossing . In fact, there were so many seemingly climactic battles that I didn't even realize that I had \"finished\" the campaign until I read about what is considered the finished campaign in the forums.    Third, there are some counterintuitive rules that I don't like such as some relating to monster focus, inability to share loot, and having to play cards to move across an empty room.  Yes, I know that part of the challenge of the game is to account for loot and movement restrictions when completing missions ... but it is just too gamey for me.    I love the opening of the new characters, the effort and love that went into the creation of the game, and the puzzly combat mechanics, so it still is a great game ... but now that the glow has worn off, I can more realistically see the game's faults.

{"username": "puckstop98", "rating": "8.5", "comment": "Great legacy aspects and interesting classes.  Pros: very long campaign where previous choices affect the future, unlocking new characters, very tight and thinky game play mechanics, huge variety in monsters, Great enemy AI, Deep lore, bad luck can be mitigated by upgrading your decks through feats and leveling.  Road and city events are neat choose your path vignettes.  Cons: About 15 scenarios in - most feel similar (kill everything or something), sometimes the character you unlock isn't as fun as the one you just retired, and the mechanics can lead to min/maxing each turn.  Road and city events are crap shoots for which choice was the \"better\" one.  Components: Neat art on the standees and the tiles, although the tiles are often a little drab.  Lots and lots of tokens.  The cards are well laid out and contain a good amount of flavor text.  The minis (that I've seen) are high quality.  The tuck boxes aren't holding up amazing and the cards are on the thin side (not an issue for people who sleeve).  Overall, it's great and lives up to the hype.  It may not be everyone's favorite as it's not your typical fantasy tropes and has replaced dice chucking with hand management.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "kingmaker5", "rating": "8.5", "comment": "Impressive achievement in board game design both in mechanics and sheer volume of content.  This game has  effectively merged RPGs with board games and has raised the bar for RPG-style board games.  PROs:  (1) scenarios are captivating tactical puzzles, (2) combat mechanics are clean, streamlined, thematic and engrossing, (3) character upgrades and progressions hook you, (4) the writing is well done, (5) great value for the money...basically you get a base game plus the equivalent of 10 expansions in the box, (6) stokes the nostalgia for pen and paper RPGs, (7) great balance (well playtested) plus variable difficulty allows you to tweak the challenge level for your group.  CONs:  (1) overwhelming amount of cards and bits...it is an extreme organizational challenge and the insert provided is not up to the task...set-up and especially break down are a bear. expect to pay money for organizational upgrades, (2) 20 pound box difficult to transport, (3) the story overlaid atop the scenarios is somewhat thin so far and not overly interesting. i'm not curious about what comes next as it all feels somewhat generic, (4) fiddly beyond fiddliness with too much shuffling...easy to overlook housekeeping tasks...there is too much housekeeping, (5) the card exhaustion system can be frustrating and dictates that all scenarios be of equal length, (6) saminess:  kill all monsters in a pregenerated configuration of rooms (2 to 6), wash, rinse, repeat--very repetitive.  interest is falling with repeated plays, (7) one player has to look at the scenario set-up, so they basically see where all the monsters/treasure are from the start (no surprise), (8) traps are visible to all (very untraplike), (9) loot/treasure system clunky and it is frustrating to have to leave most loot/treasure behind because of timing mechanism.  Rating has fallen from 9.5 to 9.0 to 8.5 after my sixth session with this beast (2 player mostly). I'm catching a whiff of tedium/grinding. On the upside, the tactical combat is still interesting and the strength of the game.   Had been my favorite board game for about 2 months, but the initial fanboy glow has faded.  Prediction:  this will not be the best RPG-style board game on the market in 3 years.  It makes a great first impression and has broken new ground but it is not the ultimate RPG-style board game.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Impressions so far:  Long setup and take down time - needs a large table dedicated to the game for longer periods for efficient play.  Very interesting game mechanics - however when playing solo I tend to get stuck in AP. May loosen up when I become more familiar with the game rules.   A lot of mental overhead to make sure playing the game correctly. I have the feeling of being both the player and the cpu in a computer adventure game. A rather time consuming process but a great, fun, and satisfying mental workout. I expect this will be less pronounced when getting used to the game.  Thus, so far, I have mixed feelings.

I appreciate the vision and the execution, but I'm just not a fan of stuffing so much content at the cost of interesting gameplay. Gloomhaven works, has smart solutions and in general is fun to play. It's just that the management of all of it is exhausting and the gameplay just isn't worth that much sacrifice. I'm also not terribly convinced that I want to play I game that wants me to be less and less powerful over the course of a session. It works mechanically, but it's repelling on a psychological level. It has all the signs of a game that will just work better in a digital form. Too much ceremony, not enough meat.

Now that we are playing primarily one-off side scenarios, it doesn't have the same momentum as it once did. Still, I have never played a game so many times so that at least is a testament to its power and I think any game would start to fatigue after so many plays.

{"username": "per42", "rating": "8.5", "comment": "After first try:  The game plays well. I like the theme and I also play fantasy role playing games so this kind of games suits me. \"Dungeon Crawl\" games are the only cooperative games I like.   We played a random scenario just to learn the rules. Next time we'll start the campaign. It took a while to figure out how it works, we did some mistakes in the beginning.   I think the rules could be organized better. I need instructions to be well indexed and structured so I can use it as a reference guide. For example there should be rules for how to set up your character early in the book. These rules are more or less set up so you have to read it all from beginning to end to get the picture, and it's always hard to follow rules this way when you have never played a game before. A short \"get started\" scenario would be nice. So for a guy who have written papers on \"how to write manuals\" I expect better. I probably should add I don't like and never use video tutorials.   I am also annoyed that game producers never learn to make room for sleeved cards. There certainly is room in the box if you remove all air under parts of the inlay, and stupid dividers in the card trays. For a game like this a well organized card tray is important so you can keep cards that are available, not yet available or out of game separate and sorted.   Unfortunately the component quality of the punchboards are very poor. On several places they were not punched through. And to sit with a scalpel to cut out that many pieces is really tiresome. And they weren't glued thoroughly so the printed papers fall off the cardboard.   I hope that the game experience in the future will be good enough to get me past these first grievances.

{"username": "sephiroth92492", "rating": "8.5", "comment": "For right now, my score reflects only having played once. We had a really good time with it, but I have not experienced a lot of the growth of the game, which as I understand, is the crux of the game. My rating may change based on that.  Edit: My score stands for now. I probably can't say it better than the many who have also left comments, but I wanted to add a few more thoughts.   First, and this is important, I think the game is a design masterpiece- branching paths, achievements locking you out of certain things, lots of unlockable content. I absolutely love the art in the game- so many unique things were created. I can't imagine how difficult it would be to try and create something like that. My criticisms are because the game is so ingenious in so many ways.  My biggest issue is the enemy AI. I feel like I run into a situation about three times a scenario where I'm not totally sure how the enemy AI is supposed to act. Maybe it's just me, but I feel like this could have been done better.  In the box, there is almost no way to keep everything organized. I feel you NEED and organizer of some kind. Some people are talented enough to make them, but for those of us that are not, most of the options are pretty expensive.   Finally, I wish they had developed a better way to track everything- there are so many little things that need tracking in the campaign. I wish that they had been tracked in one place, and you know when you hit certain milestones. There are a few apps that are pretty good for it, but I would have loved it had it shipped with the game.  Still though, we have a great time every time we play.

{"username": "bubblepipemedia", "rating": "8.5", "comment": "I'm glad I took my time to rate this. This is a really fantastic game, and quite the achievement. I finally found another game that is similar to Mage Knight after years of failed suggestions from people. I still like MK more, but there's definitely room for this in my collection. I think the people who dislike it wanted it to be more like Descent, but I feel like there's just so many games in that genre (and not to mention, Descent already has so much content and so many versions). I was worried at first about the potential for the card driven attack modifier system, since the thing I loved about MK was the fact that it was more of a deterministic puzzle. I actually might have not backed this game had I watched the videos a bit more closely (I somehow missed that attacks weren't deterministic), but I'm really really glad I did. They end up feeling just fine and adding tension to the game. If all dice games used a system this good, I'd like them a lot more. I'm tempted to use something similar to these cards as a custom variant for Battlelore and other games of mine that I wish I liked more.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Al Capwnd You", "rating": "8.5", "comment": "Few games scratch the same itch that Gloomhaven does. It is a tactical-based cooperative game with legacy elements to it. It combines miniatures, cards, and tiles to form a great experience. The downsides are the long setup and play time, but a couple of helper applications have since come along to cut down a considerable amount of bookkeeping that the game requires.  Gloomhaven is a juggernaut of a game, and one that I genuinely enjoy as there seems to be always something new around the corner to unlock and explore.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "driehm", "rating": "8.4", "comment": "3(4) player campaign: Day 1: first game, #1 (we lost horribly): 8.0 Still trying to figure out how to effectively use the cards. Many mistakes were made. One player was almost out of the game early on thanks to stupid decisions by everyone.  Day 2: 2nd try at #1, close win, felt a little too easy considering our horrible card drawing luck, awesome item reward: 8.1 The second run was relatively smooth. Everyone got to do something. Not bad for a first map.   Day 3: #2, AWESOME LEVEL, great experience for everyone: 8.8 We really enjoyed this fight. We got lucky a couple of times and won decisively. Early High Point, more like this, please. First Player leveled up after the conclusion.  Day 4: #Side Scenario by Rob Daviau, we messed up again and lost by running out of cards: 8.2 Encountered a horrible Road Event and had a somewhat miserable experience. In the end, it got pretty close, but no cigars.  Day 5: #Side Scenario by Rob Daviau, 2nd try, had to restart the map after 20 minutes and on the second try, we more or less breezed through: 8.2 Before we set out the 3rd player reached level 2. We played with only 3 players (#4 dropped out). Solid experience.  Day 6: #3, Scenario level Easy (1) with 3 players (c-lvls 3-2-2): 8.2 The hardest part was looting the treasure before the win condition hits. The Spawn Point added some small variation, otherwise nothing spectacular if you min-max it.  Day 7: #8, Scenario level Easy (1) with 4 players (c-lvls 3-2-2-1): 8.5 We should have played on Normal, Map felt too easy. The Story picks up its pace which is certainly welcome. Looking forward to seeing how this pans out.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "charlest", "rating": "8.2", "comment": "The legacy aspects (reincorporating player decisions, branching narratives, and world permanence) are all breathtaking and excellent. As a campaign game, the narrative hangs together somewhat well and it feels like an enormous accomplishment. The scope is unbelievable and the world feels alive.  The majority of play is in the tempo-based card system that you will grapple with to clear out dungeons. This is a very Euro mechanism, albeit one infused with drama thanks to attack decks with wild outcomes. The card system can be difficult to strategically grasp in your early plays, especially when engaging with one of the more difficult classes like the Spellweaver. Losing cards for the scenario can feel punishing and it seems as though the game is fighting you, wanting you to hold back.  After gaining some experience and comfort with the mechanisms, the system will turn on its head and you will feel empowered. Even at that point, the game still is a bit of a slow burn with thoughtful contemplation and heady decisions making a bulk of play. This isn't a high-speed rip roaring adventure where you cut through foes like butter. It's very atypical for this genre as it's slow-going with a multitude of high impact decisions.  What's really amazing is how well everything hangs together. The system is pretty streamlined and feeds right into the larger campaign. This doesn't feel like an underdeveloped Kickstarter game at all. That is an outright miracle given the magnitude of scope presented.  --------------------------------------------------------- Full review: http://geekandsundry.com/we-played-gloomhaven-for-30-hours-and-still-want-more/", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Scenarios are very redundant and story just isn't strong enough to motivate further playing. Also characters and items are not able to really differentiate in play style. Combining that fact with the extra long setup time (I already have lazerox inserts for fast setup) makes me not wanna play it any further.  The content of this game is just amazing as well as the main concept, but we just have more fun/minute playing other games. Seems like time is just not worth it.

The quantity of materials in this game is amazing and the game mechanics are solid. I appreciate the timing mechanic of losing a card from your deck every time you rest - once you are out of cards, you are knocked out/die. The aspect of playing two cards and taking a top and bottom action creates some angst and difficult decisions. The characters feel uniquely different in how they play. Wish it played five.

{"username": "martidem", "rating": "8", "comment": "Great dungeon crawler with a lengthy and intricate campaign storyline.  But the vast majority of scenario objectives are \"kill everything\" and even with new character abilities and playing different characters against different monsters, this can start to feel samey.  There are also a couple things that are overly fiddly and could've used some streamlining.  So far, however, I'm really enjoying it, but my rating might drop a little over time due to these issues.  EDIT: After completing the campaign, I'm keeping my original rating. I do still think that some mechanisms are overly fiddly and could've been streamlined. However, the varying monster AI, how some monsters can present different challenges in different layouts or when encountered with other monster combos, the changes in gameplay for the unlocked classes, and the periodic puzzles presented with scenario objectives really kept the game feeling fresh for me even after 60+ scenarios.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Fribian", "rating": "8", "comment": "This looks like an incredible game. At first I didn't want to invest in it due to Legacy thing and permanent stickers. I'll play it like it is because it looks incredible. One could get extra stickers sheets and probably use a plastic overlay if they wanted to spare the Gloomhaven board. There are 95 scenarios in this game when playing in campaign mode, and it might take you more than once to conquer a scenario. Will you play 95 scenarios? This game will be valuable for playing for many many sessions.  WHAT I LIKE:  - The rule book is really well organized, if you use the back of the rule book to look up icons, they'll point to the pages of interest in a lot of cases - Game play is brutally fun. The choices in each and every play of the cards is amazing - Playing solo is a blast, complex, and very thought provoking.  - This game is a monster like none I've ever experienced so far. I can see that I may never finish playing it, and still this is only season 1, there is a second expansion in the works.  - I love the greed element here. I find myself wanting to run back and grab that single coin, only to find myself overlooking something that gets my character exhausted! LOL. I love that even though it ticks me off that I was greedy enough to fall for it. I wanted that coin!  - I love the secrets in the game and not knowing what's in the envelopes and the discovery. - There's always a bit of a story to each new dungeon which is somewhat interesting - I like the big map board and the fact that only half of it's there. This indicates to me there's possibility for another gigantic expansion at some point to finish up the huge map. I don't know that I can ever finish even what I've got now, but that's interesting. Potentially there could be 100 big monster boxes for each chunk of giant map board added.   DISLIKES:  - It's one big fiddly game to get setup, but will probably get easier with experience playing it. You have to dig out the tiles, and monster stands, but part of the fun is forming your party and picking your characters I guess. But there's so much to consider and figure out for each dungeon. - Punching out everything and organizing stuff is a real challenge - I do not like the tableau tracking for experience and hit points, but they'll be fixing it in the second printing on Kickstarter. I started using the spinner wheels from D-Day Dice to track these and it works OK. Later on I had someone at work print me 4 3D printer plastic things to put some blue and red d20 dice in.   - There's too much stuff to track and setup with this game. If I wait too long between games, I have to really dig through the rule book to refresh myself. I'm making mistakes by overlooking things during play as well. It's really almost too much for campaign play unless you plan to spend time with it getting used to the rules and all the things you have to track. - It's easy to make mistakes and I constantly forget to draw modifier cards (sometimes for monsters, and sometimes for myself) - I'm not sure there's that much \"adventure\" to the game other than maybe the cards you draw for the road and city events. You kinda feel like you're on an adventure, but it's really just one battle after another. ", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

It is probably too combat focused & with less variability I would like to see in the mission's goals.

{"username": "Frohike", "rating": "8", "comment": "I only have 4 plays under my belt so far, but I think it's been sufficient to get an idea of the general slant of the campaign experience. The parts I enjoy are mainly legacy-level and the use of delayed consequences, the slow reveal of scenario chains, sidequests, simple Crossroads cards events, and world state changes. The legacy conceit works very well with this genre.  However, I'm still not quite sure where I stand with the core of the scenario play. It seems to take the concept of a D&D 4th edition session, deconstructs it down to micro-events spread across dual purpose cards, then re-assembles it into something where you spend every initiative round frowning at cards, deciding which to chain together, which will be ok to discard for the next X rounds, which will be good to burn for the rest of the scenario at certain points, table-talk about who moves where, who can infuse the battlefield with an element that someone else can use with their card, etc, etc... all for a single round in a skirmish with a handful of bandit fodder.   It sounds interesting on paper but it can be taxing, especially if taken as an experience of playing a board game emulating an RPG-in-a-box. Looking at it from that angle, I feel like the freedom and playfulness, and straight up velocity of the genre is pared down to cardplay that feels oddly restrictive, fussy, and slow despite the agency that it provides in the game (and those cards do allow you to do some really cool stuff). It's like you have to squeeze through this gauntlet of boardgamey analysis, just to pull something off that would have taken quick clearance from a DM and the roll of a d20. But I think I have to resist looking at it from that angle because I suspect that the smaller narratives being churned through game mechanics is exactly what a board gamer coming at this genre from their own angle may expect. Case in point, there are tons of Mage Knight fans. I'm not one of those fans, for somewhat similar reasons as I'm conflicted about this game. This takes that crunchiness of systems propelling simple diegetic events and extends it, almost obscenely, across potentially years worth of play.  It's kind of a baffling game for me, at this point. It's something to be marveled at, but it's also a commitment that I'm not sure I'm going to find anywhere outside of solo play. My game group is most definitely not ready for this, and my son, who normally eats up this style of card play, is turned off by endlessly shuffled, swingy modifier cards (effectively a mutable d20, disguised to assuage die aversion) that can easily [i]tank[/i] an hours-long scenario. So yeah, there it is on my table: a sea of solo campaign play, but also a brain burn. I'm not sure how often I want those two aspects joined together.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "cafin8d", "rating": "8", "comment": "The more I play Gloomhaven the more I like it. I was concerned repeated plays would get tedious, but the changes in tactics introduced by different heroes / maps / monsters and in-play cards makes each game a truly entertaining experience. I find the story elements to be the weakest part but I've never been much for storytelling in my games, as I prefer to let the story build in my head as I play (like Arkham Horror). And for tactical play, this game is nothing short of genius. The biggest down side is that the lengthy setup time, even with storage inserts, really prevents it from coming out as much as it should.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Dennis Murray", "rating": "8", "comment": "We finished our campaign, so I thought I\u2019d update my thoughts. I have played over forty games (some I forgot to record so I\u2019m not sure) and although I have not been present for every game I have been for most.    The card tactical combat system is very good and quite gamey, which is the main thing that has kept me interested. Each scenario is a puzzle to be solved, using a combination of current group powers and strategic approach. No matter how hard the scenario, it\u2019s rare that we can\u2019t beat it on a second try with a revised strategy. Combining cards and equipment is interesting and the primary draw of the game. But I still think the card play in Mage Knight is more interesting.   Most of the rest, I\u2019m afraid, doesn\u2019t do it for me. Admittedly I don\u2019t own the game and so don\u2019t have the luxury of delving into the background as much as I'd like (but thanks to Isaac for avoiding dwarves and elves and orcs...I would never have played if they were in the game). I\u2019ve tried to care about the background and story, but I just don\u2019t.   The rules system, beyond the very clever card use, is an odd combination of clever and silly. Why is there never anything to hide behind? Why do exploding things hit your enemy but not your allies? Why can you do wounds and poison and such without actually hurting the enemy? How come I can\u2019t knock my enemy into a pit?   Regardless, it\u2019s impressive as hell. A huge fantasy campaign in a box that doesn\u2019t require a gamemaster. Scenarios can be very samey, but particularly as the game goes on you run into more variety. Monsters vary in their powers and can greatly effect the personality of a scenario, requiring different strategies. The player characters have interesting differences that cause new approaches.   So...it\u2019s good, but mainly as a tactical combat game. It certainly destroys Descent in that role. If I hadn\u2019t committed myself to the campaign at the beginning, however, it\u2019s unlikely I would have played this anywhere near forty times. It just doesn\u2019t have enough story to pull me back. Even my fellow players who enjoyed it much more than me are looking beyond the end of the campaign as they tire of it.   When will someone who can write a good story do something like this? All in all, it was fun, though it lasted too long for my tastes, but it\u2019s no Mage Knight. I\u2019m a little unsure how to rate it...I certainly have no interest in playing again, but using BGG's system would place it way to low. I give it an 8 so as to give it credit for what it achieved.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "bucklen_uk", "rating": "8", "comment": "OMG, was half expecting this to be the usual 'meh' kickstarter - needing development. Oh no, this is rock solid - an immersive coop which is really hard to quarterback, each player gets their own unique deck.  Legacy elements are engaging, whole thing is amazing. Was considered unloading it for a profit before it arrived, now frantically painting minis and desperate to play again. Love it, love it, love it :)  *** Update,  Should have expected this shine is a bit off now - yes it's definitely a solid game and I'll happily play, but it isn't getting to the table as much now. Why? Story isn't that immersive really and all the side quests and everything seem to distract a bit, but the worse is the \"what happens when we mess up and fail a scenario\". You do it again - really, I'd rather not, certainly not with the same characters it feels too much of a MMO grind, I much prefer Arkham Horror LCG's approach - you fail there are consequences, both for the characters and the story. Here, nope - go back to your last save point and try again.  Oh and other bits are now starting to irritate to. Not wowed by the whole legacy thing - unlocks etc fine, but the legacy thing, nope, but worse is the road and city encounters which just basically randomly stuff you before unless you happen to guess right or have the right characters along. Scenarios are tough enough (or can be adjusted up if you find it easy) without that - and then factor in I'm fed up with the risk of 'do it again' in the case of a failure and the game isn't being played.  So, overall - clever design, great tactical game but the whole campaign bit not so keen now.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Cheesechick", "rating": "8", "comment": "Based on 2 plays with 4 players:  Is this game the dungeon crawler to end all dungeon crawlers? The answer is... I'm not really sure yet. It's a fascinating game, one which takes ever facet of the genre and condenses them into a series of smart interlocking systems that provides an unprecedented level of interesting choices.  That's not to say that the game is fiddly or overly complicated. It's not. There's a LOT in this game, so it does take some time to learn. But generally, things are intuitive and elegant. But while its rules aren't \"complex\" per se, its web of interlocking systems is [i]demanding[/i].  And that is arguably the cost to having the systems push and pull each other in such interesting ways. This game is [i]extremely[/i] mentally taxing. In other dungeon crawlers, there's a natural cadence to the strategic depth - earlier scenarios don't require much thought, and per-scenario the amount of mental gymnastics you're doing depends greatly on the number of enemies currently on the map. Not so in Gloomhaven. There's a massive amount of forward planning required in every decision - because you're always under the clock.  The \"clock\" is not the usual turn limit, but something much more interesting and player-driven, and as a result, complex. Running out of cards equals death, so card management becomes a complicated, nail-biting affair. From the very start, EVERY choice you make can have massive unforeseen (at least, by newbies) consequences. Doing something as simple as taking a turn to rest sees players untangling a knot of possible future outcomes when deciding which card to lose.  So that cost? Add \"game length\" to it. After all, when [i]every[/i] decision is a  brain-burner, the only result is taking time to consider your options.  So while Gloomhaven is hands down the most interesting and strategic dungeon crawler yet, I'm not quite sure it renders others obsolete. How much you agree will depend on how much you value those moments in other dungeon crawlers where you get to take a breather or make mistakes - having moments where you DON'T feel the weight of the world crushing down on you to just relax and have fun. Before Gloomhaven, I hadn't really considered the value of the times when your choices are obvious, or wiggle room to waste time. Of every dungeon crawler, it is the most [i]unlike[/i] D&D.  Is ~2.5 hours of mental labor fun for you? Or is it too much? For me, personally, the mechanics are such a goddamned joy in themselves that I'm happy to take the time... but I will acknowledge that I hope once we're more familiar with the rules and our characters that either its choices become a little more straightforward [i]sometimes[/i] or scenarios speed up a bit. Because after playing one game of Gloomhaven, I'm ready for a nap.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The campaign/story growth are interesting, but the real heart of the game is its dungeon-crawling combat. The rest is mostly window dressing.   The variety of abilities and mechanics between races is also very well done. And leveling those characters, while slow provides plenty of options to customize your play.

The promise of character and world progression compel us to play this game repeatedly. The permanency of the legacy aspect can be easily mitigated with careful planning. I will say that this is one tough cooperative game. The races and characters play very differently with their individual decks, and have steep learning curves in order to optimize your performance in each scenario. And without that optimization, you will fail. In many ways, this game's cardplay reminds me of the hand management in MageKnight. The major difference though is that where I felt MageKight to be fairly abstract, this game is much more thematic. The game doesn't come across as a straight grind for progression. Instead, you're given many options as to how and where you'd like to adventure. For now my one reservation is knowing that at some point I'll have to retire the character that I'll have grown a deep attachment to. On the flipside, I know that it'll unlock another exciting character to explore.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

My favourite game of all time!  15 plays later and the game still has me excited! Despite retiring to a character I'm not convinced I quite like as much as the Scoundrel, I still look forward to returning to the game.  27 scenarios later: Just retired my second character, which I grew to love. I just opened a new character with some very interesting mechanics. I hope I get to play around with them for a little bit.

{"username": "The Nue", "rating": "8", "comment": "It's a big ol' box, and it is chalk full of stuff... and that stuff is good. This game is fun to play, filled with variety and choices to customize your play experience to taste... play alone, play with friends. And the content is just... endless... and not in a bad way. It's pricey (especially if you aren't paying retail, since copies are in short supply and some people are profiting off that on ebay), but the amount of stuff in the box and the time it can kill, it's all but a bargain. I'd estimate this game could kill about 200 hours without repeating a single scenario. Now, that time is only as fun as you find the game, of course... changing characters and playstyles can mix things up, but it is ultimately one game, and that's a long time to play one game. A few points of advice? Big, long setup/teardown... pulling down one scenario and setting up another can take more than an hour pretty easily.... I DO find however transitioning from one to another takes less time than putting the game away and pulling it back out... so marathoning multiple maps in one go is just time efficient. Likewise, consider investing in and an accordion folder... you can only speed up your setup/teardown so much even then, but honestly you'll want to do what you can to shear down that time.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

It won't hit my table again, but will remain a fond gaming memory.  While the narrative aspect of this game didn't quite live up to what I'd hoped for, the tactical combat was very satisfying. Discovering and developing characters was rewarding and really well implemented. Toward the end of our run, setup time came to be a chore, which contributed to my desire pack it in for good.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "exparrot", "rating": "8", "comment": "I am really enjoying this. I love the card management mechanics here which are truly unique and add a different sort of puzzle to the standard dungeon crawl fare as you must weigh your options as sending cards to discard for a lesser affect means you can possibly get them back ...but getting a larger effect from them means they go to the lost pile and there is no getting them back. Run out of cards and you are exhausted and removed from the scenario.  The first scenario or two were quite a chore because there is so much here. There was a lot of back and forth flicking through rules books but I have to say the rule book is very good with a fairly substantial index and further reading references within the text.   The story is good and moves along at a fairly brisk pace and we already feel our actions are actually having an affect and shaping the world. Each of the characters plays differently and the flavour text throughout is wonderful.   It would be nice if there was a little variety in the scenarios rather than them all simply being kill everything...but it may develop that way.. we shall see :)", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The GH history and rise in the BGG ranks is well documented, and people in the forums will have vastly more detailed information to add than me, but my 2 cents on the game is it's fantastic but really requires your commitment.   In our current tabletop world where a game that was printed 2 years ago is considered \"old\" and one made 4 or 5 years ago can be a \"classic,\" GH doesn't let you get away with a biannual play in order to enjoy. You will directly get out of this game what you put in, and that ceiling is very high.   It seems to draw a lot of inspiration from Mage Knight, but GH is definitely a defining game in it's own right.

Positive: Interesting hand management Not much rule overhead, clean design Brings right amount of challenge, there is a good amount of tension in the game Decent amount of decisions (not only where to move or what to attack) Coop feeling - players must collaborate to succeed, but there is also posibility of the negative interaction (loot, be selfish) Encourages communication between players without alpha player syndrom  Negative: long setup, but there is room for improvement with good organization of tokens and cards Some fiddleness, but related to tokens and cards moving around the board, not the rules overhead.

{"username": "enzo622", "rating": "8", "comment": "OK, I\u2019m updating my comment after several 4P games. It\u2019s good but not great IMO. I\u2019m surprised that people are going as gaga for it as they are considering how surprisingly fiddly the game is. Reading the rulebook makes the game seem straightforward but there are some very fiddly aspects about monster movement, card effects, elements, etc. that prevent the game from rising to the level of elegant. I\u2019ve made a list of those rules we always seem to have to revisit and the more I play, the fiddliness becomes more prominent to me than any elegance.   The cardplay mechanism of top of one card, bottom of the other offers a great puzzle, however, I\u2019ve come around to the side of those who complain that it\u2019s a lot of work just to walk across a damn room. Wish your character had an innate movement ability.   Honestly, I would not have predicted this game to be so well received considering how onerous it can be to manage all the aspects. There are times when we have 5 or more enemy AI decks on the table and have to manage the instructions for each AI group. Then you have all these room and overlay tiles to find and, well, I\u2019m just glad there are several of us. To those who play solo, my hat is off to you.  None of these are overly complex per se, but all together they add up to a level of friction I wasn\u2019t expecting. I thought it\u2019d be more streamlined. [i]Did we adjust the element track at the end of last turn? [/i]   Last criticism is the grindiness. If you fail -- and you will fail your share of scenarios -- you have to go do something else or repeat. Playing a dungeon the first time is always exciting b/c you don't know what's behind that door. Playing it a second time to check it off the list is less so.  In sum, I think it\u2019s a good game but there\u2019s too much rules friction for it to rise up to a 9 or 10 for me.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

No. Its fun, but not the most fun that I have ever had playing a game. I suppose for me its missing a real competitive aspect. Beating the bad guy - card driven AI is fun, but not nearly as fun as beating another human whose mind you need to outwit, outplay and overcome. PVP will always be more exciting than PVE - for me. Others want an Epic Coop campaign game need not look further than Gloomhaven. The mechanics are slick and easy to learn - despite the multitude of tokens and bits you get with this game, I never felt overwhelmed. We used the app to play, so that takes care of a lot of the bookkeeping aspect. Its a bit of a chore to set up though, so you want to play a longer session to make the set up time worth the effort.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

You could strip away the scenario book from this game and the mechanics alone would make it a keeper for me. + Having all your cards in hand at the beginning of the game and choosing two cards every turn is fun and creates awesome combos. + The attack modifier deck is great. The fact that you can upgrade it to mitigate the risks is awesome. + Leveling up is very satisfying. So many great choices when building your characters deck. + Each characters feel extremely different. + So. Much. Content.  What I dislike: - Why do designers keep putting random results that cancel your attacks? Null results can be really frustrating. - Terribly time-consuming to set up. I've had to resort to using apps to help me track things during a game and help ease setup time. - The scenarios are not very well balanced.

UPDATE: After playing few more scenarios, it's a very good dungeon crawl, although Dungeonquest is still my favorite. Setup and teardown are an absolute pain for Gloomhaven, but gameplay is solid. There's a few nonsensical things though, like weapons that you have to throw away after using them (???) (note: not literally throwing them away, in the trash :D ). Dice-less combat is interesting and Legacy parts are fun.  Overall, a very good, but also hugely over-hyped, dungeon crawl. I'm having fun playing it, though not setting it up.   P.S. Components quality is pretty low. Had to glue together lots of tiles that were coming apart due to lack of glue... and the game box is pretty flimsy.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The amount of material is out-of-this-world and the most I've seen in any game I've played. The box is huge so you get a lot of bang for the buck. It seems very chaotic on how to play the game at first but halfway the first scenario all pieces magically fit together and you get more experience on how to play the game. I think this game grows on you and only gets better after the first couple of plays. Looking forward to going through the scenarios with my wife. I just need some time to start playing the game.

{"username": "StalkingButler", "rating": "8", "comment": "It's a good game, if not the second coming.  It has the best combat of any dungeon crawler I've played.  That may be class dependent, though.  Besides that, the atmosphere, writing, and legacy elements are all lacking 10 games in, so the storytelling aspects of the game (D&D in a box) are aren't doing much for me.  Almost every scenario is a variation on 'go kill stuff', which could wear thin.  Still, the combat is so good that I'm happy to keep playing.   We started with 4, and then we went down to 3.  The game seems much better and tighter at 3 players.  Also, we've never lost a mission.  I'm not sure how I'll feel when we do.  It's been close a few times.  I would dread having to actually redo a whole mission, but the fear of losing has to be there for the game to actually be fun.  It doesn't seem like the rewards scale very well for choosing harder difficulties, which irks me.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}
{"username": "Sprayoncrayon", "rating": "8", "comment": "Tl;dr It's 22 lbs of amazing.  This is like having an epic DnD campaign where no one has to be the DM.    Mostly dungeon crawls, and mostly about killing all the enemies, but as you explore, you unlock new locations.  Players can also travel back to the city to re-equip and get random encounters on the road.  All players form a party that can gain and lose reputation, increase the prosperity of the town, unlock global achievements, etc.  Individual characters have personal goals that once they achieve, will retire and unlock new character classes.    Characters who complete missions will gain gold and experience, and can level up, gaining access to new skills and abilities.  Characters can also improve their odds in battle by completing mini-goals during scenarios.  They also can buy equipment, loot dead monsters, or open treasure chests to reveal more stuff.  Combat is handled by cards, and selecting which hand of cards you take into battle can be it's own puzzle, because your hand size is limited.  Each round, you use up two cards, but if you run out of cards in your hand, you can shuffle discards, permanently losing access to one of them.  If they all run out, you're exhausted and out of the scenario.  There are other ways you lose cards from your discard pile as well  If everyone becomes exhausted, you lose.  Randomness is also a factor, because each character has a combat deck that could improve or hinder their attacks, with one critical hit and one critical miss card.  Players can modify this deck through achievements that grant perks.  Players can select which perk to gain, and when a character retires, they can pass some of those perks on to the next character that player will use.   Monsters are controlled by some pretty basic A.I. rules, but each type of monster has its own deck of cards telling the players what they will do that round, as well as a monster attack modifier deck.  Difficulty of monsters can be scaled from level 0-7, and each monster type has stats for basic and elite units (with special abilities).  There is a fair bit of bookkeeping that has to be done during the round, and lots of little cardboard bits to help keep tack of temporary modifiers.  What's great about the game is the narrative arc that takes place during the scenario.  Each player starts out with a whole lot of potential, and facing some known enemies, but no one knows what lurks behind closed doors.  As they go through combat, their ability deck acts like a countdown timer until they will be exhausted, so there is a rush to blitz through all the enemies, but you have to have a plan.    In our first mission, there were three rooms, and after clearing the first room, two of us were almost exhausted, and I didn't think we would make it.  And when we opened the third door to a room full of monsters, I was certain we were going to fail.  But we managed to eke out a victory, and it was very satisfying to do so.  The icing on the cake was the flavor text in the scenario book, which has 95 different story-driven missions.  Add to that a map that unlocks locations as you play by placing stickers, and you have a very cool game.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "bogman", "rating": "8", "comment": "Great game play. The desire to develop your character is high. Why is it not a 10? The aesthetics are weak (the minis are not great, I don't like the standees, and the dungeon graphics are bland). Getting the components out for newly encountered enemies is tedious. The table quickly looks like a mess (Descent is much stronger, visually...but then again I've painted all those minis).  Other observations: Character effectiveness seems to vary greatly, or I am just way worse than my kids :)  10/17 Rio and I finally stalled out on this one mid way through the campaign. We spent a LOT of hours playing, but eventually it started to feel like work, and some of the characters are just less fun than others to play, or just not very effective without more characters to work off of.

On the downside there are a lot of rules that you need to understand and keep in mind ALWAYS, which can be frustrating at times. You will have to read the rules over and over again until you have it all covered and this can break the game flow quite a bit in the beginning, but it's awesome once you're more experienced.

{"username": "CosmoVibe", "rating": "8", "comment": "Gloomhaven has a couple of advantages: It's intense and immersive when you can afford to play over multiple missions and get a feel for all of the different systems the game has to offer. With the unlocking and retiring of characters and mission difficulty scaling (and not being punished for failing missions), you can bring any of your friends in and out any time you wish. While it does play fairly well, there is a fair bit of rules and administration including setup, and some of the systems do feel pretty bloated at times. However, the sheer amount of content, the flavor and lore, and the unique format of board game, makes this an impressive title that is worth it if you can find the time and people to play with.  It should be noted that due to the small margins in which you can secure a victory, your playstyle is a little bit forced, so it plays more as a strategic game rather than an immersive dungeon crawler. I would've liked a game like this to be more of an experience than a puzzle, but it should be kept in mind when selecting this title.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

There are a few wonky things though that veteran rpg players will find jarring (knowing whole map setup before you enter, traps being visible, the whole I cant tell anyone my initiative thing, and more).

So far GH has a really engaging story and compelling character progression and it doesn't even attempt to deliver a rich game of maneuver.  It trades most of that tactical stuff for more puzzle-type gameplay in it's card play which is really satisfying.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Flaming Spud", "rating": "8", "comment": "Gloomhaven is overhyped.  Gloomhaven is very repetitive, asking players to essentially do the same thing over and over each session, with one or two changes to the challenge presented by varying monster types and scenery.  Gloomhaven costs a ton of money, which is justified by the quantity of scenarios and sheer number of pieces, but the actual quality of all those pieces is lacking by today's standards.  Gloomhaven is an absolute disaster to set up and tear down.  But Gloomhaven is also the best dungeon crawl game I've ever played, beating out my stint as an RPG player by a mile.  There's always going to be some considerable admin with games like this, but Gloomhaven streamlines it better than any of its peers and gets players to the good part faster.  And I don't think we'll ever finish all of the scenarios, not for lack of trying.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}
{"username": "PermaFrost88", "rating": "8", "comment": "It is without saying that this game is unrivaled in its content. The story is immersive, each play begging you to advance the storyline. I think this is one of the strongest points in the game.  The mechanics of the game are also great. There is tension among teammates in trying to select the correct order in initiative. I just wish there was more anti-co-op mechanics so that the team would struggle more to communicate.  The character development and progression is well done, but not without flaws. Some of the cards of each of the classes are not as useful. I had wish there was more of a talent tree with more in depth specialization.  The replayability of this game is not high, since most of the draw is from unraveling the storyline and unlocking characters.  This game could take a hint from mage knight to improve upon many things that I had mentioned.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "schkff", "rating": "8", "comment": "Lots to love about this fairly unique and enormously ambitious Kickstarter-spawned monstrosity. The world - particularly the races and character types - is original and intriguing, and gameplay (ie combat) is engrossing. Building up decks (or character progression) is also well-designed - but as for the campaign play and unlocking of features itself: it\u2019s a brutal slog, frankly. The quality of writing in the encounters is sub-par, and the actual choices are uninteresting. The scenario book spoils the element of surprise that would put this more into the dungeoncrawl than tactical miniatures combat category, which is a bit disappointing. And the map is silly - \u201clegacy\u201d is fine, but why print it on a game board instead of just card stock or paper? The lack of \u201creal\u201d travelling is a let down. This game only exists because of Kickstarter - it is inconceivable that it would emerge from development from a real publisher in anything like this format - all those terrain boards that are mostly similar anyway - why?  But, frankly, it\u2019s a masterpiece. The flaws are irrelevant if a game is fun, and for all the hype around this one, people aren\u2019t playing it unless they are enjoying it. A glorious mess, that will hopefully inspire other designers to tackle this he challenge of creating an epic GM-less fantasy campaign board game. For now this is an admirable try, well-worth playing.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "SniperDan84", "rating": "8", "comment": "Components - .7/1 Cards are great (and there is a lot of them), chits for the monsters are good. Points loss is due to the map tiles, although nice looking they don't link up well. I've gotten peeling on the linking tabs because the cuts aren't uniform enough so there is a lot of light forcing them to sit flat. In addition the rulebook is extremely scattered, and I believe that is because of the legacy/campaign modifications. Every section is very good about explaining itself, the layout of where you find things is the problem.  Fun - 1/1 This is just a fun game. We try to sneak in a scenario every little window we can. I don't know what more to say than it's engaging, there's very little downtime. Since each character has their own deck you tend to avoid the alpha gamer problem. The biggest weakness would be some could take forever picking their cards by analyzing every single possibility but we simply haven't seen it.  Replayability - 0/1 A little harsh, but it is a Legacy game. They sell a separate removable sticker set but it isn't included with the game so as is the few legacy elements prevent the game from being resold and played fresh. Obviously as a campaign the story would never be new but there is a few decisions that just seemed like cashing in on the legacy game craze.   Strategic - .9/1 Monster's AI decks are shuffled and every attack done by players and non-players have a modifier revealed. That being said, the monster AI rarely can't be mitigated, you learn the general speeds of the different monsters and you see what they do before you go if you're faster than them, or if you plan on going later than them you can setup for what they will do. The attack modifier decks can certainly screw you over at times, but as you level up you get to lessen the negative effects of the deck, and generally speaking you want to avoid monsters hitting you regardless of what they flip. In the dozens of scenarios played, we've had a few deck draws that screwed us over, but all except maybe one of the plays we recognized bad actions we took earlier in the scenario that put us in a position to require specific card draws.  Theme - .9/1 Basically all of this game exerts a classic fantasy style theme. I even enjoy the exhaustion mechanic regarding theme. As you do more things you become more tired, you need to rest more often, etc. The only knock I have is the complete lack of penalty for failure. You can keep repeating a mission over and over again, and technically getting stronger each time. That being said, the mechanic makes sense from a game play perspective but it is the only real thing that just takes me out of the experience.  Personal Review - 4.5/5 I am against the concept of legacy games. I would never ban people from creating or buying them, but I refuse to purchase them. That being said, this would get a 5/5 from me if it didn't include those aspects. As many have said, the legacy components of this game is small and not crucial and I agree. That reason alone is what frustrates me most about this game, the components I don't like weren't really needing to be that way, but they are and so the rating take a knock. Outside of these small odd decisions, I really enjoy this game. The card exhaustion mechanic is implemented in a fantastic way. The unique characters really makes alpha gaming very difficult to do which can be a problem in co-ops. The world as explored through story events is enjoyable and just all in all the game is a whole lot of fun.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

I didn't experience any WOW factor yet, but there were some really interesting, tough decisions regarding the cardplay and tactical combat. I definitely need to play it some more.  One thing I wasn't particularly fond of is the fact that you start the scenario as the \"strongest version of yourself\" and you only get weaker and weaker with every passing round (same thing was true about Claustrophobia). I prefer dungeon crawlers that give me the sense of progress, not regress over the course of the session (Mage Knight did this right). ", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "dmn1414", "rating": "8", "comment": "[2018-07-02 Rating: n.a. -> 8] It's not so easy to come up with a rating for Gloomhaven. For everything I do enjoy, there's something I dislike. While I was quite impressed with the game when we started playing it, after 12 plays I'm not so sure about some design decisions. Still, I don't feel like I can write a cohesive review of Gloomhaven yet. So I'll just list my likes, dislikes and neutral points and hopefully, I'll find the time to update my comment after playing some more:  + I do enjoy the core mechanics of the game: The character deck building is fun (caveat: We are all still playing the starting characters), the action selection is great and really hinders an alpha player and the monster AI decks really make the monsters behave differently.  o Luck: Whenever we lost a scenario, it was mostly due not knowing  how this scenario has to be played yet. Some scenarios want you to be quick and you have to avoid fights, in some scenarios it's okay to use and lose your best cards in the first room and other scenarios save the hardest monsters for the last room. But there's really no way to know which kind of scenario you encounter when you enter a dungeon for the first time. I guess, that is part of the fun of a dungeon crawler but whenever we replayed a failed scenario again, we knew what to do and finished it quite easily. It feels a bit as if the game is cheating a little here.  o Until now, most of the scenarios feel a little samey. Get in, kill all the monsters and be done. But this may not be the fault of the game, there might very well be some more interesting story paths and we have already encountered some other, more interesting scenarios.   o We are still not sure if we are cheating sometimes or if we make the game harder for us than it should be. This has to do with monster movement which seems to leave some room for interpretation as you can see [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1903355/monster-ai-quiz]here[/url].  - Fiddly. Gloomhaven is the most fiddly game I know. It got better since we started using apps (Gloomhaven Helper and a campaign app). Before that setting up a scenario, keeping track of hit points/effects and everything else was a chore and killed a lot of fun. So I'd say an app is mandatory.  - I think the scenarios are a little too long. With 3 players, we normally finish them in about 2 hours. Unfortunately, it's very unlikely that we play more than one scenario at a game night because of the game length. I would really prefer them to be more in the 60-90 minutes range.  All in all, I have to say that I do enjoy Gloomhaven at this point in time. The core of the game is rock solid and makes for a nice puzzle. For now, Gloomhaven is an 8 for me, but I'm not really sure if my rating might drop in the future. Our plays start too feel a little samey. But time will tell.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Would like to see alternatives given during scenarios and more 'out of dungeon' play around the town of Gloomhaven and surroundings.  I'd hate to see GH2 just become an update of the mecahnics an more bits... the're plenty of stuff in the box to support hundreds of well written and crafted campaigns.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Sam and Max", "rating": "8", "comment": "Blows the tired old dice-chucking out of the water. The cards (somehow) give you plenty of options, yet you can't do the same ol' thing every time. You start off with *all* your options available (ie. your entire deck of about ten cards) so you don't feel constrained by \"what you drew this turn\". While the cards are similar (eg. area attack vs. two targets) they're different enough that you need to puzzle through how to use the cards most effectively. And the cards are part of your life (you also have boring old hit points -- er, health), so you have to manage how you use them. But if you *don't* like card management (\"Whaddayamean I can't backflip and ninja stab him in the nuts every turn?\") I don't think you'll like Gloomhaven.  I do like how the game system still lets you continue (and enjoy) the game without committing to a campaign. The game accommodates players dropping in and dropping out between sessions. And too many campaign games have the interesting part of the game between missions. With Gloomhaven, the game itself is challenging (although I suspect repetitive killing could become, well,  repetitive).   As others have said, there's a lot of content in this game. I'd say that, had it been released retail, the publisher would have broken it up into a base game and several expansions, with a total price of *much* more than $150. OTOH, If you don't like the game system, you're still not going to be happy with your purchase. This is definitely a \"try before you spend this much money\" game.  GH still isn't the holy grail for me, since it has those tired hit points as well as a whole bunch of numbers all over the place. The math isn't difficult (and numbers printed on cards are hard to escape on any game design), but I think the next step after you've removed dice is to stop it with the numbers. Because when you get sliced with a sword, you don't say \"I'm down by three health\".   Thematically, were it not for the game system, GH would be yet another dull bland generic fantasy dungeoncrawler. While you have these weird character races, they don't feel particularly integrated with the world, at least as described in the initial scenarios. Contrast this to, say, the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game classes which feel based on their respective worlds.   Still, if you can handle complex Ameritrash rules and don't already have several dungeoncrawlers and want one, GH is a very good start. Much better than wasting your money and time on yet another dice-chucker.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

This game is an excellent blend of the two with some interesting, unique game mechanics. Additionally, the story, i.e., legacy aspects, of the game propels you deeper into the game.

However, I'm only rating it an 8 and not a 10 because of how fiddly the rules are. It takes even a dedicated board game nerd many rereads of the rulebook and FAQ and many plays to get to the point of not making rules mistakes. The core rules are pretty simple, but there are so many exceptions and edge cases. Nevertheless, the complexity does make the game have excellent balance, and excellent difficulty scaling.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "gatchaman", "rating": "8", "comment": "Update after many, many plays solo -- my conclusions are still the same. Amazing content, too much fiddly stuff. So rating remains 8.  -------  We're several plays into it now and though there is a ton of good stuff to like in here and a fair amount that could have been cut out.  The amount of content is amazing, written adventures galore, and it's not linear, you can go where you want. The different characters play very differently. The monsters feel and act differently because of their individual decks. All really good stuff.  But I think it needed another pruning pass in development. There's just too many little parts to the game that could have been streamlined -- the elements waxing and waning, the individual mission quests, elite vs regular monsters, different kinds of resting...and on and on. It's all reasonable and I understand the point, it just doesn't need all of it.   Plus there are real usability problems with the monster cards and keeping track of which is which, and tracking hit points. They just never figured out a good solution here, although clearly they tried.  It really drags with 4 players, and despite all the different adventure write-ups, all of them feel the same. Gameplay gets real same-y after a while, so at 1-2 hours this would be fun, but when a session drags on to 2-3 hours it's lost the thrill.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Stately Wayne", "rating": "8", "comment": "This game isn't for everyone, so I caution people that they may think this game is one thing when it's actually another:  This isn't a traditional dungeon crawl. It's not as simple as MOVE X, ATTACK FOR X, KILL THE THING, STEAL ITS STUFF. Nor can you control your character's actions with the machine-like regularity of typical tactical games. The action card selection process makes this a -- well, choose your gaming jargon: Resources management game? Hand management game? Programming game? Straight Euro game?  This won't appeal to you if you will be frustrated by occasionally having the badly bloodied boss three squares in front of you, with nothing in your hand that lets you walk up and polish him off. Sometimes that guy is just going to stand there, mocking you, while you take a turn to wipe the blood off your brow and consider your poor life choices up until that point.  Here's one that takes getting used to: See that chest in the corner? If you don't scoop that up before the end of the scenario, you don't get it. It waits there for the next explorers who fight their way in and make a play for it.   Gloomhaven requires a slightly different headspace than some people might anticipate. If you can't find it for a reasonable price, maybe you can breathe easy knowing that it may not be right for your preferred play style anyway.  But if it fits your style -- as it fits mine -- you'll find Gloomhaven to be a rewarding, thinky, and addicting box of discovery!", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The steep price tag is a little hard to get over so recommend going in on it with friends who enjoy dungeon crawls and pseudo- legacy style games.

One final suggestion would be to check out some of the game master apps/websites that have been developed for it as it DRAMATICALLY quickens set up time and reduces fiddlyness.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The \"persistance\" (now known as \"Legacy\") of it, the character builds with cards is great, millions of components makes the box feel really worth it's prize (ok, kinda). There are some kinks as well.  Setting up a session is a nightmare, even if you have sorted the components. We have never managed more than one run per 3h session, and that's, well, a bit of a downer. Also, practically everything is cardboard, and some of the stuff comes appart rather easily.

{"username": "Tom W", "rating": "8", "comment": "I bought Gloomhaven in high hopes and our group played about 10 scenarios, and then it never hit the table again. I suspect it never will. It\u2019s set up and out away times are very long, I get the cringes just thinking about setting it up. The game is fun, but very repetitious with endless grinding. The progression is glacially slow. It is a fun dungeon crawl, but the emphasis is on \u201ccrawl\u201d  Don\u2019t get me wrong, I thing the mechanic is fun, and if I actually felt like I was progressing each session, instead of having to play 3 sessions (7.5 hours) to go up one level, I might find it easier to maintain interest. As it stands, for the time involved, I\u2019d rather play High Frontier, which also involves building card combos, solving a \u201cpuzzle\u201d and even better - has a competitive bidding mechanic.   In terms of finding a sweet spot, for s dungeon crawl game, I think Imperial Assault is more likely that GH to make it to the table again this or next year.   Still, kudos to Childres for making such a unique labor of love. I saw o e review that said \u201cif I had one game to take with me on s deserted island, Gloomhaven would be it\u201d. I think I agree with that mostly, though I would find some way to cheat and also bring Kingdom Death and Nemo\u2019s War. ", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Martin Ralya", "rating": "8", "comment": "Playing a faraway friend's copy, I knew going in that the full Gloomhaven experience wasn't on the table -- there would be no way to play a campaign, or really see the legacy elements, and I'd heard that it was a lengthy campaign to boot. We squeezed in three plays.  Session 1: The combat is dry, and just seems like extra work to achieve the same thing as many other more fun dungeon crawlers. Lots of bits, too many options, too much infrastructure. Why would I play this when, say, Shadows of Brimstone or the D&D Adventure Game series exist?  Session 2: Whoa, this combat system is great. I get how my character plays, and it's really satisfying. I love how the game largely prevents the \"field marshal problem\" prevalent in so many co-ops.  Session 3: This game is awesome. I can play my character well, and I'm starting to make clever moves. I also understand everyone else's characters pretty well, and can predict where they're headed and how to play into that.  I wish I could play this more, and likely give it a higher rating based on the nifty-looking long-term elements, but that's unlikely to ever happen. Rating the game in front of me, this is a solid 8.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

I think its very impressive how much pressure is put on the players by the hand management game though.  Watching your seemingly endless options dwindle as everyone creeps close to exhaustion and failing the game only to come up with a plan that can snatch victory from the jaws of defeat and have everything break your way to succeed is what Coop dreams are made of.  It has a ton of bits to sort though and its plenty fiddly but if you like crawling through dungeons you are bound to have a good time with Gloomhaven if you can find a regular group to play through the campaign.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}
{"username": "PraneFuji", "rating": "8", "comment": "Gloomhaven has been a lot of fun for my family and my friends. I enjoy the gameplay, and the challenge the game has brought to the group. It really shines in comparison to Imperial Assault, which is another game I've enjoyed but suffers from quarterbacking, and a 1 vs 4 gamedesign. While I can get demoralized if we repeatedly fail a mission, I generally don't feel as terrible as when I'm crushing the rebel players in an ever increasing snowball of a campaign. I enjoy the 50 some odd hours we have put into gloomhaven, and the systems that allow multiple parties to play. The legacy system is pretty great.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Other games do a better job of giving delivering at the surprise factor front.  If the team works together it's fun. I still don't know if we're just slow or if a 4-play scenario always takes 3 hours.

It\u2019s great fun to play, and once you\u2019re in it it\u2019s hard to stop, but man, it\u2019s a chore to set up! It\u2019s the only reason we don\u2019t play as often as I\u2019d like, because it takes about 20 min so set up, and that\u2019s if I find everything quickly.  Other than the set up though, this is a great game, with so many scenarios and different playthroughs, characters and monsters. The campaign set up is genius with first building your character and being able to boost capabilities and then retire it and start with someone new.  The way you change the world in which you play is also really cool, the different requirements to play different scenarios is simply incredible.

Gameplay and choices are unique enough to be fresh, but familiar enough to make it easy to grasp.  Biggest gripe is that there is SO MUCH OF IT!  Without proper storage the game takes so long to set up and break down it is prohibitive to playing it more.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Groule", "rating": "8", "comment": "Despite the \"hype\" associated to it, this game is very good, no doubt, but it also have many impairments.  In few words, the main game mechanic relies on combing cards, each one having 2 powers. This mechanic, inspired from Mage Knight, is very clever and pleasant to play. Beyond that, the game is a classic among classic RPGs. Its structure reminds the one of a video game, no more. Material is far from perfect (quantity but not quality). Story is ok, very classic. Rules are ok but often confusing (hundreds pages of FAQ).  So yes, this game is unique by its gameplay and its deepness, seducing at first sight, and deserves its thousands of fans over the world. But in my opinion this #1 position has to be slightly tempered.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "PrimogenGames", "rating": "8", "comment": "Gloomhaven is a great 4 player game with almost infinite re-playability. The characters and theme are unique and the game concept is one of a kind. It definitely has elements worthy of borrowing & building on for a great board game.  Where I think this game shines starts with the characters.  You really get attached to your character and the other player's chosen character, and you have a lot of flexibility to customize their abilities and items without making characters overly complex.  There are very few action cards I'd consider \"useless\", which is both good and bad as it can be really hard to pick between some.  The scenarios and plot lines are a lot of fun intermingled with city and road cards that drive group conversation (although at times, I think I rush these in hopes to get into battle).  Where I think Gloomhaven could do better is first providing a game box with better storage / organization for components (including sleeved cards).  Upon purchasing this game, I instantly found myself searching for better storage / organization options.  Better organization cuts down on setup and take down time which can easily run over 30 minutes on both ends for 4 players who have progressed further along in the game.  I'd love to see each character have a more organized storage box that keeps stuff \"ready to play\".  The admin in this game is also pretty intense.  When you have 4 different monster types (standard and elite) and 10+ monsters on the board, you have a lot to manage just to get through a round.    A personal opinion - I really like high quality game components.  I'm not a huge fan of cardboard HP counters, character mats, board game tiles, monsters, etc.  I'd love to see a version of this game with more 3D components even though it would likely double the price and the size of the game box.  Still with my few critiques aside, I really enjoy playing this game.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Oftenmartin", "rating": "8", "comment": "By far the game we've played the most over the last year, year and a half. Being able to play several groups on the same legacy board makes things a whole lot easier, especially in these adulting days where jobs and families claim much of our time.   The game itself is so much fun. The progression of the characters and the exploration of the world has really hooked us. One day we might even get to finish it fully!   I can see issues where players try to dominate and control other players actions, but in our group that has never been an issue. Mayhaps because we've embraced the competitive aspect of this game. Even though we work together to finish a dungeon, our motivations and goals differ, and we play that to its fullest.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "El_Pollo_Diablo", "rating": "8", "comment": "First off, I cannot emphasize enough how flat-out impressive Gloomhaven is. From the art design to the mechanics to the writing, this thing is a fantastic achievement in board game design that honestly everyone even remotely interested in dungeon crawlers or, heck, even traditional roleplaying, should try at least once. The focus on strategic deck use instead of dice rolls is an incredibly unique approach that emphasizes thoughtful strategy over a \"roll and pray\" style. There's still an element of chance using a different deck of cards that acts as a dice, but that deck ALSO evolves with your character as you level up. There's way too much good stuff to go into regarding how this whole thing is constructed - monsters that level with you, how scenarios beef up to match the number of players, interaction decks for both in town and on the road, simulating the RPG experience without a GM - it's just a technical masterpiece. And to think this all came from ONE GUY? Isaac Childres deserves some kind of medal for this thing, if he hasn't already got one.  THAT BEING SAID - I personally have a couple of hangups, so while I absolutely admire and respect what's been done here, I sometimes hesitate to bring it to the table. First, there's a LOT to keep track of here. From enemy decks to your own decks to status changes to a unique \"element grid\", each turn can be a mental workout to make sure you're taking in ALL the factors and doing things right - and that's even with an app to help! Second, the heavy emphasis on a character's growth is his or her own personal skill deck, which can only really be upgraded through leveling up. The other half of adventuring in traditional dungeon crawlers/RPGs, that being cool treasure, weapons, armor, etc., feels very... perfunctory. Like, yes, you can get stuff to equip and help you through the dungeons, but they're almost all one or two-time use extras rather than a consistent aid. So, yeah, you can wield a great axe, but it's only going to let you do like one or two swings per scenario, and then it's back to your built-in character powers. A minor quibble, but for me it made every treasure my wife and I found or bought feel far less cool than I wish it had been.   But still, if you haven't played this yet find the nearest friend you know who has it and demand a game. Try it for yourself, see if you want to buy it and jump into the (100+ hour!) campaign. Everyone deserves to experience Gloomhaven at least once.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

What you have in Gloomhaven is a tactical minis game bookmarked by story elements in an ongoing campaign - where you can level-up in unique and interesting ways.  All 3 aspects are well implemented in Gloomhaven.  The cardplay at heart of the tactical minis game is quite thinky and fun.  The opponent AI system results in dynamic and surprising board states.  It's very good.  The level-up system is also very well done and makes you feel like you are working through a tech-tree.  But many of the branches are viable and all of them are interesting.  The story seems well written, but it is not a huge draw for me (yet?).  Personally, I don't care that much about the bits of story. ", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Scelestrus", "rating": "7.6", "comment": "Awesome game. The legacy elements, the card play, the changing characters everything just clicks. Played 9 hours with my gaming buddy and can\u2018t wait to play again it\u2018s addictive as hell.  Update: The further I get in the campaign the more I realize that this game actually isn\u2018t as good as many people (and I was one of them) claim.   Critizism No. one: I just can\u2018t get over the fact that I finish a Dungeon and have to leave it and the loot literally lying on the floor around me without being able to pick it up. Sorry but that\u2018s bonkers.  Critizism No. Two: If I fail a dungeon I can just do it again. There is no penalty except the loss of time. Thematically it also makes no sense. The setup is aleays the same as if time had resetted but i still have my XP and Gold from the last try. Again Bonkers. Looting is essential to any Dungeon crawl.  Critizism No. Three: it in my opinion becomes repetative very fast because once you realize how your Deck works you can pretty easily find out how to optimize it. That\u2018s when you realize the game will stay the same for as long as you have your character.  Critizism No. Four: There are problems with the balancing. Firstly if you retire one of the charakters far earlier than the other players you get the problem that you\u2018re to week to keep up. Secondly some Charakters level up faster than others adding to this problem. Both problems are due to the fact that the game raises the difficulty with your proficiency. Again thematically it makes no sense. Why should Monsters level up with you? If you progressed deeper into a dungeon where the deeper you go the more dangerous it gets it would make sense but not in an open world.  Critizism No Five: The story is so generic I get bored by the flavour text. The story doesn\u2018t do it for me at all. Sure it might still get better but there is no incentive to find out.  I had it at 9. then lowered it to 8. Now it\u2018s a 7.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

A dungeon crawl game without roll and resolve was a thing (and might still be THE thing) I was really craving for. But in the end I might realize that this whole genre is just not for me.   Its hard to put my finger on exactly what fell flat for me, but it just feels too slow and fiddly and I can't stand the feeling you get when you draw the wrong 'combat card' at the exactly wrong moment.

{"username": "sdougla2", "rating": "7.5", "comment": "Gloomhaven is an incredibly ambitious game, and a bit of a beast. It's a legacy RPG dungeon crawl, but it distinguishes itself from other similar campaign or one-off skirmish games with the sheer quantity of content (it has 95 distinct scenarios and roughly 1,700 cards), card driven mechanics, sense of progression, and story elements.  I tend to dislike most combat dice resolution systems, and I much prefer the combat deck system in Gloomhaven. It allows more gradual changes to combat ability, and I like the probability distribution better. The hand management is also an interesting constraint, and serves to drive a lot of the tension in combat.  Gloomhaven is a commitment, but it's a good chunk of what I wanted out of RPGs like D&D and more than I expected out of a campaign dungeon crawl.  On the other hand, there are a few areas where I see room for improvement. While the game comes with an incredible amount of content, particularly for it's price point, the component quality is not the best. It's serviceable, particularly if you sleeve the cards, but many similar games have higher quality components. Probably a fourth or less of the actual content, but nicer components. The box really doesn't come with a good method of storing the components, so you'll need to figure out a storage solution.  In addition, I wish that there were fewer places I had to look to resolve a monster turn. You need to look at the monster action card and compare that against the attack modifier and the monster ability card every time they attack, and if that could have been streamlined down to 2 places to look I feel like the combat would flow more smoothly.  It's also a long game; a scenario can easily clock in at 2+ hours, and a campaign is ~60 scenarios. In some ways I wish that the combat was faster paced, and more emphasis was placed on the encounter cards and choices outside of combat. I really enjoy the road and city events, and I'd like to see that idea fleshed out more. Sometimes the combat goals don't line up with your character's long term goals or play style, and I would have liked it more if the battle goals were tied into the character's career goals more or at least given more thematic justification.  There are some other aspects of Gloomhaven that are poorly implemented. The class balance could use some work, many class cards are unnecessarily awkward to use, summons are awkward and often useless, it feels like you should be able to move more freely if you don't do any other actions, and the action economy for some of the long term effects and looting creates awkward situations and tempo problems for certain classes.  Still, Gloomhaven is a big step in the right direction, and there is a lot of fun to be had with it.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "ajlaw", "rating": "7.5", "comment": "This game is very good!  There are many reviews out there describing the combat system, character unlocking, leveling up for characters and the city, and replayability.  I have a positive view of all these aspects of the game. For me, the only downsides to this game are the large amount of table space required to play, the amount of set up and tear down time, and my inability to get everything neatly back into the box after playing.  The box is already huge, but it still probably needed to be sturdier and larger because of component weight and the inability to put all items back into perfect cardboard sheet form.  This is the best dungeon crawler I have played.  Initial score: 9  Edit:  I purchased the Meeple Realty insert and now everything fits into the box very neatly.  The amount of table space has been cut down by the use of a fan made app controlling the monster decks.  Set up and teardown times between scenarios are still long, but are a perfect time for bathroom and snack breaks and conversation about how we were just able to pull out a victory in the last scenario.    Edit: 23 Sep 2017:  There are so many scenarios and I usually have to play them more than once...once to meet the victory condition and another to try to get any treasure chests since I rarely have enough cards left to do both.   This is making it feel a bit grindy.  Even with this the game is still a blast. New Score: 8.5  Edit: 6 Dec 2017:  I still like this game, but I wish that leveling up made me feel more powerful.

{"username": "tinyclanger", "rating": "7.5", "comment": "It's not a simple game but the basic choices and actions are well explained so after a couple of turns the game starts to flow. This is quite an achievement for a game with so much going and so much stuff in the box.  The action deck for each character is really different and creates radically different options and shapes the gameplay. There are lots of difficult decisions to be made and the different monster deck forces players to stay on their toes.  The game isn't without significant downsides: Character progression is a grind, and there is just too much stuff to setup; map tiles, monster standees, behaviour and attack decks for monsters, player decks, player attack decks, lots and lots of different tokens. I would be more inclined to play more often if setup was quicker. Some aspects of the game just seem to add unnecessary clutter for the sake of it.  Overall a really entertaining game in a giant box containing many hours of gaming. But one very much In need of some streamlining. Since playing a few more times, I've definitely found the slow rate of progress has dulled my enthusiasm for Gloomhaven.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "foldedcard", "rating": "7.5", "comment": "The indie Kickstarter sensation of 2017. Epic-in-scope campaign game by Isaac Childres. Interesting game mechanisms with hundreds of hours of play where you will play, level up, and retire multiple characters over the course of a 50+ scenario campaign. Unique fantasy world with decent story but feels a bit twee at times. More fundamentally, a number of drawbacks prevent this from being a great game for me... It's a huge grind -- most scenarios take 2-3 hours to play, which is too long in my book for the small amount of progress you make per scenario. Scenarios run long primarily because the combat resolution phase is fiddly and takes a while to play out. Most scenarios involve defeating all enemies, sometimes a big bad, which becomes very repetitive. In most missions you are usually racing to defeat everyone before your hand of cards run out, which means you have to be frugal with your most powerful cards as you play. (Unlike Mage Knight you won't gain any new cards as you play a scenario.) This can get particularly frustrating when you can see that you don't have the cards you need to complete the scenario about three turns out. (You are forced to replay missions you fail.) And don't get me started on setup and take down - H U G E box, hundreds of cards and tokens and fifty odd map tiles are a total pain in the ass manage.

{"username": "stephen_the_geek", "rating": "7.5", "comment": "Gloomhaven does a lot right. But it also does a lot wrong.   Its core mechanic is quite compelling. You get a hand of cards that you play two at a time (one for the bottom, one for the top). When you decide you need the cards you've already used, or your hand depletes, you remove a card from your discard and get the rest back. This creates quite a compelling puzzle. To add flavour, all players have hidden goals for the current mission and an overall personal quest which means they will sometimes act selfishly.   The game's AI is pretty decent. The AI behaves sensibly and the individual decks for the monster types work really well to give each different monster a unique feel.   So why a (relatively) low rating?   Well this will be controversial but I think Gloomhaven does too much. There is a huge amount of content in Gloomhaven. So much so that the sheer number of components increase the setup and pack up time of this game dramatically. Even with a good organisation system this makes setting up Terra Mystica seem quick. The setup and pack up time are so brutal that you basically need to have a dedicated table for it or it will never be played.   In addition to this, there are a lot of wasted components. The quad - fold board is not needed at all. The city and road decks are a waste of cards. There are 90 scenarios, which means that there is a ton of environments and monsters and to deal with that there are a ton of cardboard punch-out boards. Finding the ones you need takes time. And like when you get too much Lego you end up spending more time sorting and organising than playing.  The legacy aspects are tacked on and don't add anything at all.   This game would have been far better if it had a better economy of components. I think I would have appreciated it more of it had have been half the cost with a third of the components/ content. There is a full game here with just the starting character classes and 30 scenarios.   Gloomhaven is a good game that requires an environment to support it. If you don't have a dedicated table this won't get played. Which is sad because the game itself has so much to offer.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

For me, I felt I just couldn\u2019t devote that amount of time to solo play even though I like the game. Also the set-up and tear down time along with deciding how to store all the bits between games (which would no longer fit in the box easily) put me off playing. I find the game unnecessarily bloated. Each new scenario doesn\u2019t look that much different from the previous one so I don\u2019t see the point of all this stuff. It would be worth it if the game looked magnificent with each new scenario but to my eyes it looks generic each time.

For a thematic game, the design isn't shy of sacrificing some thematic connection for creating mechanisms that increase tension. This can lead to interesting but a bit wierd experiences.

It looks to me that the game requires a lot of admin and prep.  Also i would never buy it myself.

{"username": "skybreak", "rating": "7.5", "comment": "Gloomhaven is... fine. On the one hand, it's an impressive design and production achievement and I can see why it's #1. On the other hand, it's more difficult and consuming than I had imagined, even though I went in expecting the game to basically be a grind through a long campaign.  There is no tutorial or hand-holding scenario to help get the basics of the game down and understand how the various interconnecting aspects work. Ideally, the game would have had some simple starter scenarios that walked through enough situations to see how the basic actions, modifiers, conditions, effects, movement, etc. etc. worked, probably helping in this manner until the first level-up. Then, from there starting off where this game actually starts off.  And it's out of the frying pan into the fire with the second scenario. To be fair, I did play all but the last game three-character solo, and I realize now that's probably a mistake. Going forward, I will be using two characters when playing solo.  I see myself playing it more, but I also see myself gradually playing it less and less. The sessions seem to take too long with little reward, and hard-won battle goals seem to just vanish on the road too easily, which seems like it might be just setting me up for disappointment. It's good, I like Gloomhaven. But, I'm not sure I'm going to love it. We'll see.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

But however smart and innovative  the design is ( and that it is: really smart! Combat, Difficulty setting etc. just to name a few things that stand out), it's a dungeon crawler. And a very challenging one at that. Why do I play Dungeon Crawlers (Boardgames and Videogames alike)? Because I love to loot and I love to see my character evolve from a pushover to the arcmaster of the arcane. And I love to see progress soon. No need to jump from 0 to 100 in a day, but the next step from 0 shouldn't have to be waited for too long.  Admittedly, we (Spellweaver, Tinkerer, Brute) probably didn't play well on our first 3-player game, but we stood absolutely no chance against the first scenario set to normal difficulty.  We hardly made it to the final room. There was bad luck involved too. The road surely didn't kill us with kindness and several times during combat we drew the right cards at the wrong time and the wrong cards also - at the wrong time. And drawing cards at the wrong time is, when compared to a dice-based combat system, like rolling low when you need to roll high. With one big difference - it's like rolling low when you need to roll high taking thrice as long! Because you went back and forth in your mind making plans, trying to figure out the best move that also leaves you with the best options for the turns ahead. Rolling a die doesn't involve this kind of planning. A die resists plans. When you roll it, it says \"Whatever, dude!\"  Don't get me wrong. There are enough dice-based combat games out there and like I said above, I dig the mechanics of the game. But with the time I have for board games these days, it'll be hard to get this to the table. You'd need to play this at least once a week to really immerse oneself in the campaign and sometimes I don't get to play in a month. I'd love to play more frequently and I truely wish to play this game more, but that's not entirely in my hands.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Godzillian", "rating": "7", "comment": "# of times played, as of this comment: 26  POSITIVES: 1. Well-designed classes provide uniqueness and flavor 2. Character progression feels rewarding 3. Damage modifier deck enhances character flavor and progression; also my favorite part of the game 4. Hand management rewards well-planned combos and teamwork 5. Well-designed Monster AI decks and abilities make the monsters feel extremely thematic 6. Elemental infusion and how it works really encourages teamwork during a scenario 7. Team Lingo during scenarios (read: Hanabi) feels extremely thematic (and hilarious at times) 8. Battle Goals make each scenario feel different and provides a nice challenge each time 9. Town Prosperity feels rewarding when leveling up 10. Scenarios have great flavor text before and after, and really gives meaning as you play through them 11. Scales extremely well between 1 to 4 players 12. Is supported by both the designer and the fanbase, so even when you run out of scenarios to do in the box, there will be plenty online 13. Comes with so much content that you can use said content for your own fan-made scenarios, or even other games or RPGs like DnD  Even though this game is a 10/10 for me, there are definitely flaws. No game is perfect.  NEGATIVES: 1. Characters progress slowly. This in part makes character progression more rewarding. However, it is *definitely* slow, and you can expect 2 to 3 scenarios before you see your character level up or gain a perk. This is NOT good for players who enjoy a *constant* feeling of progression. Note that this is NOT a problem for Solo Play, because you'll most often than not be improving one of your 2-4 characters that you're controlling. For Group Play, I suggest allowing an additional checkmark per scenario, while increasing the scenario level to balance out the increased amount of perks. 2. Town Prosperity levels slowly, and sometimes randomly. The random and slow gain in prosperity makes Gloomhaven feel less dynamic and more static, as you'll come back to Town seeing the old items still for sale. 3. The Town is not as exciting as it should be. City Events are great, but there's only so much a single card can do to make you look forward to your *next* Town visit. A good Town phase should make you look forward to the next Town phase; see: Shadows of Brimstone, Frontier Town expansion. A suggestion to fix this would be to implement SoB Town Phases - have the concept of a \"Day\", where each character can decide which one shop to visit. Certain items would be available only in certain shops. Additionally, after each \"Day\", a City Event would occur. The amount of days that you can spend in Gloomhaven can be a formula: AverageLevel(Party) + Reputation(Party), with the minimum of 1 day for the output. 4. Party reputation is not great. The fact is that your party reputation will not go up or go down consistently. This is (randomly) affected by what scenarios you do and what city and road events you draw, and often times you won't even know until the outcome is read. You cannot plan to have your party to be the most reputable bunch, or to be the worst scumbags. ", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "glax", "rating": "7", "comment": "Good, willing to play, but don't love it. Way better than D&D, some nice mechanisms, and scenario balance seems very good. But the feeling of progression is slow and the time investment is huge. Our plays have averaged around 4 hours per scenario with 3-4 players. It just takes quite a long time to select cards each round, and while I love the amount of choice and wouldn't change it, I would adjust the feeling of reward that players receive for that investment.  Based on our plays so far (5), there are about 500 hours of content in the box. Like most games with lots of content, I feel the designer assumes you will love their creation as much as they do. Therefore the scale of action is such that players spend as much time as possible in the world. But IMHO, less would have been more here, with content better staged as separate acts with a well-defined story (tension-release) structure that was more rewarding. Gaining a few gold tokens and maybe 20 XP per scenario may be balanced for the design, but it feels glacial.  Finally, after 5 scenarios, I haven't found much of a hook to the world of Gloomhaven and its inhabitants, and while the stereotypical fantasy tropes aren't present, the ones that are just haven't grabbed me. Maybe I'm in the minority and we'll see where it goes, but the trick to the Lord of the Rings e.g. was that it was the *world* that was the main character, not elves, hobbits, dwarves, etc. So I'm hoping that the world of Gloomhaven will grow to be more unique and be worthy of the time spent here.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Chris Freiberg", "rating": "7", "comment": "There is just a lot about Gloomhaven that doesn't really work for me, even though I've been engaged in a semi-weekly campaign of it for most of the past year. The combat feels really constrained and lacking in interesting combos for the PCs, the retirement system sucks most of the fun out of character progression for me, the CYOA options in the encounters seem too obvious most of the time, the scenario goals are too simple and repetitive (either kill all enemies or run through the dungeon to the end, over and over), and the story frankly isn't terribly compelling.  Update: After playing and during a lot of pseudo-DMing reading fluff for Mansions of Madness last weekend, at my next session I came to appreciate more how knowing the lore gives players a handle on the mechanics and theme of this game. I like how we're trying to cheer up the gloomy city, and that prosperity can only ever go forwards. With the right group, this is a pretty good RPG in a box.  2nd Update: The alignment system here seems to fall into the same trap that so many computer RPGs have. Choose the selfish evil option, get a reward that ends up being a pittance next to the reward reaped by consistently following the supposedly selfless good path. Nice life lesson, but it's a clash with the supposedly gritty shades-of-grey fluff here and in games like Fallout. I pretty much have no motivation to ever even try to play an antihero. My group has pretty much abandoned the conceit of the hard man mercenaries with secret selfish motivations that are supposed to restrain player cooperation at this point, except to occasionally jokingly stop to do a dumb thing in-game for \"reasons\".", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "boardgamesdotEXE", "rating": "7", "comment": "A fairly tactical dungeon crawling experience. It isn't a roleplaying game, but does feature character growth similar to what you might find in RPG video games.  The game features enjoyable combat mechanics, good hand management mechanics, decent dungeon crawling, and a ton of environments. The scenarios are rather samey after a while, but the classes add a lot of variety. My first complaint is the monster AI. All monsters of a type run off a single AI deck, so if you're fighting 10 skeletons, ALL 10 skeletons will take the same action when they take their turn. It makes the monsters feel fairly stupid - groups of monsters function as a hive mind rather than sentient entities. Even the different monsters are fairly similar to each other, excluding bosses. Monster A behaves nearly the same as Monster B, except Monster A can move 1 additional space, and Monster B has poison!  My biggest complaint however is how darn fiddly the game is. Setup WILL take anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes, though scenarios after the first will go faster due to having the pieces out already. An organizer will really help with playing sequential scenarios.    If you like vanilla dungeon diving for dungeon diving's sake, this game will provide hundreds of hours of scenario-based content for a little north of $100. There's probably no better bang-for-your-buck in that regard. In the end though, it's too fiddly for me and too samey for me to really love it. I just think it's pretty alright.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "quietcorn", "rating": "7", "comment": "This is a dungeon crawl game with a sprawling ongoing campaign and certain legacy mechanisms where you alter the map, and your characters across multiple plays. The game is completely diceless, so it relies on a flip-luck card driven combat modifiers, which are a little more interesting as over time you can customize the contents of the various combat decks to a certain extent.  The writing is well enough for a game like this. Not terrible, but not very compelling. The components are rough, as rather than this being a game with tons of nice minis, everything outside of player characters are standees which can be hard to see or differentiate from each other. Health and monster stats are also tracked off on the side of the board, which means it can get confusing as to which monster does what and who has however much life left.  Mechanically players are fueled by ability cards, where you choose two cards from your array, then use the top half of one and the bottom half of the other. At times this can be an interesting puzzle, but over the course of the game you wind up losing cards from your array, and when the players lose a map, it's more often to players falling over due to not having enough cards left to finish than it is to actually getting trounced in an interesting tactical puzzle. I find this to be somewhat disappointing when it happens.  Downtime between turns is also quite long not only because of the awkward bookkeeping but also because as players chose their cards for the next round. They aren't allowed to talk about what they plan to do specifically, so turn order flies a little blindly with players stumbling over each other at times.   :nostar: Art, Iconography and components functional :star: Clever or interesting mechanisms :nostar: Reasonably low downtime between turns with mildly AP players :star: Multiple plays stay interesting :star: Low or mitigatable luck elements :star::star::star::nostar::nostar: Raw enjoyment", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "wkover", "rating": "7", "comment": "The moment I backed the 2nd edition on KS I regretted it, but (spoiler alert) it turned out not to be the huge mistake that I predicted. I bought it to play 2p with my son, and he loves it. I also think it's pretty fun.  [i]Warning:[/i] Before playing, I put in an 8-hour workday to punch everything out, sort counters into plano boxes (x2) and counter trays (x2), read the rulebook, research and select starting characters, flip through the rulebook a second time, scan the [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1897763/official-faq-game-revs-1-and-2]FAQ[/url], set up a practice game, and wonder whether I should purchase the removable sticker set (answer: no).  I expected the 51-page rulebook to be a disaster, but the 2nd printing smoothed over most of the rough edges. We're playing almost 100% correctly at this point, though [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1727703/easy-miss-rules]this list[/url] of easily missed rules certainly helped.  Major caveats:  - The game is permanently set up on a basement table. If I had to box/unbox the entire game every time - or haul the game to a friend's house - there's no way that I would continue the campaign. It would be sold/traded/burned under those conditions.  - Even in perma-table mode, setup and teardown isn't entirely trivial. But it's obvious that Gloomhaven should be prescheduled and set up before the other players arrive. And really, the setup isn't that much more time intensive than any other cardboard-heavy adventure - again, assuming that you don't have to unbox the game from scratch.  - As with most dungeon crawlers, more players simply adds more time. Two players is perfect, as games are short (60-90 minutes) and you don't have to worry about corralling multiple players every week.  - We took others' advice and played on Easy mode until we leveled up.  By the way, I really like that XP are tied to thematic character actions (e.g., backstabbing or disarming for the Scoundrel), not simply monster kills. That's pretty clever, as are many other things about the game.  But yeah, I expected to hate Gloomhaven. It just didn't turn out that way.  Update:  For a poll on solo versus multiplayer popularity, click [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1911071/poll-solo-vs-multiplayer-popularity]here[/url].  And go [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/article/28870180#28870180]here[/url] for a playtime survey.  A record of our 2p campaign retirements:  (spoilers!) [o] Player 1: - Scoundrel (starting level 1, retirement level 4) - Elementalist (starting level 2, retirement level 9) - Doomstalker (starting level 4, retirement level ??)  Player 2: - Mindthief (starting level 1, retirement level 4) - Spellweaver (starting level 2, retirement level 9) - Sunkeeper (starting level 5, retirement level ??) [/o]  [b]Final (?) update:[/b]  We lost our motivation to finish the campaign.  I peeked ahead at my next unlockable character, and it appears to be even less interesting than my current one. So Gloomhaven has been packed up and put away - likely for good.  It's an enjoyable game (off and on) and innovative in many respects, and I mostly got my money's worth: $99 for 40 plays and ~60 hours.  But ultimately its repetition, grindyness, and [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/article/28650432#28650432]other drawbacks[/url] wore us down.

{"username": "Pozman", "rating": "7", "comment": "Well, to be honest, I don't feel the hype at all. The gameplay-style seems to be exact the same as any dungeon crawler: you clear room by room, but the dice are replaced by a stat that you modify with a random card.  The action selection mechanism of cards and cards that are permanent out of your deck if you use there stronger ability is nice, but it doesn't make me feel I'm playing something exciting, completely new. This feels like a 99,99% dungeon crawler like Arcadia Quest, Massive Darkness,...  We're playing Wouter's copy of the game, and I hope I'm wrong, but I'm wondering how long the game can keep my interest: If the next scenario won't simply be more rooms with maybe some new type of monster we haven't seen before, but for the rest more of the same?  Minor remark: what also didn't help is that if you fail scenario 1, you have to completely replay it, while you know exact where which monster will be :s", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Phrim", "rating": "7", "comment": "Gloomhaven is a campaign-based dungeon crawler with a lot of interesting elements.  Most games like this will feature a dice-based attack based on whatever weapon you happen to be using.  Gloomhaven does away with all of this--each character class has its own unique deck of cards, and card play will determine exactly what your character will do doing each turn.  Instead of using dice as a randomizer, there is a modifier deck that adjusts the values of attacks.  The neat thing is, as the character advances in level, cards can be swapped into either of these decks to make them more effective.  Another major difference from other dungeon crawlers is that this one really feels like a race against time, as once a character's cards are all gone, they effectively die.  The game also features a very interesting meta-game--in addition to the aforementioned character leveling, scenarios are structured in a branching structure instead of being linear, and the players unlock new character classes and other story elements as the game progresses.  While the dungeon crawling aspects are interesting, the character and story progression is definitely my favorite part of the game, and I wish the game spent more time on this.  So, while it's a really good dungeon crawler, it still doesn't really transcend the genre into something more.  (5+ plays)", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "DroppEcho", "rating": "7", "comment": "Not the second coming that BGG thinks it is, but a solid dungeon crawl game with a couple of unique mechanisms.   I see way too many usages of the term \"Euro\" with respect to this game - that's crazy.  There is nothing remotely \"Euro\" here, but there are a couple of \"simple\" ideas.   PROS:   * Characters can retire after completing what seems to be a small number of scenarios.  This can allow flexibility in the play group. * The card selection mechanic for each combat round leads to some difficult and interesting choices and some good group discussion (top/bottom). * The timing aspect and deck thinning due to cards lost for the session is quite interesting as well. * City and Road Events provide some options and variation. * Cool, unique and interesting character classes. * Fun co-op experience, and I don't usually like those. * Leveling up and equipment shopping are satisfying. * Ambitious design and long-term scope. * Tons of product in the box.   CONS: *  There is surprisingly little art and illustration in the game. Tons of text. The box cover is a bit misleading in that regard.   Graphic design isn't too appealing. *  Tons and tons of fiddly NPC/AI things need to be managed.  I feel like the game really wants to have a GM or Overlord player.  Or a computer. *  Sometimes the boardgame rules get in the way, or trump, the RPG aspect.   All the treasure and loot disappears when the last enemy is killed on a map?  That's purely there for game-y reasons. *  The narrative and story elements aren't too compelling.   The world isn't (yet) all that rich or engaging. *  The little wooden XP and HP markers a joke.   They don't work in the slots whatsoever.  (This has been addressed several different ways by now). *  The miniatures have a bit of a low-res 3D-printed kind of graininess to them.   *  Unsure about the magic system. *  Moves a little slow.  90-120 mins per scenario with 4p.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Rontuaru", "rating": "7", "comment": "I am averse to rating Gloomhaven too high, and still I feel my rating here is *very* generous. If I were to evaluate its mechanisms and concepts in a vacuum, it should in truth yield a much lower rating for me here. None of the mechanisms are particularly original or thought-provoking. Ratings are subjective, of course, and so for context, my ratings generally describe how much I enjoy playing a game, and factor in how much it vexes or enthralls me and gets the cogs truly whirring in my brain. After numerous plays, I began to compare Gloomhaven to the games which I have rated an \"8\" or above. My plays have yet to evoke the same sense of character that I feel from those games. Gloomhaven does not offer the same emergent gameplay depth from simple mechanisms. It does not beguile me or make me feel clever for exploiting pre-defined constraints. I do not finish scenarios of Gloomhaven and have them pervade my mind days or weeks later. A \"7\" seems fitting, at least for now. Each play is a fun diversion, with a fault that is easy to forget amidst the chrome and the content.  Gloomhaven falls victim to the folly of most, if not all, cooperative games: It is merely an exercise in no-fallout puzzle solving. At worst, you fail, but in truth you merely lost to some inanimate game automa, and this same concept taints each victory with a light pang of hollowness: \"Congrats, you have successfully exploited the intended loopholes in the automa.\" In fact, the most ardent devotees of Gloomhaven on these very forums stress time and again that this is the optimal way to play: exploit the outlined mechanisms of the game to eke out little advantages here and there, even if they are unthematic to a scenario, for the game was presumably designed to be so treated.   \"Oh, hey, if you position yourself down this corridor, that monster has no way to get to you except walking through three sets of traps. Good thing it will do JUST that!\"  To reiterate, this is not necessarily unique to Gloomhaven, but to nearly all cooperative games. Gloomhaven just possesses so many exceptions and exploitative mechanisms that they are the forefront of the game. It pains me to see it often compared to DnD. The latter has a wealth of soul which Gloomhaven could only dream of possessing. DnD monsters do not have a one-track mind, as they are operated by a living, breathing, calculating and cunning person. Gloomhaven facetiously parades itself as a dungeon crawler, when in truth it is a predictive stream of cooperative euro-puzzles masked with a dungeon-crawling skin.  HOWEVER (and this is a significant clause), having said all that, I do feel that this title deserves all of the accolades it has received, if only to acknowledge the marvel of board game design that Isaac Childres has achieved. If you've followed his design blog at all, or played a game with him in person, you will find that Isaac is an astoundingly meticulous, calculating, and methodical fellow, and his gaming philosophy oozes from every single crack and crevice in the world of Gloomhaven. I have no doubt it took near unfathomable hours of dedication to balance the interactions between players and monsters, to consider all aspects and exceptions of this automa that he has designed, and to offer such a wealth of content at an almost unrivaled value (do NOT feed the scalpers, the experience worth 100-150 bones at most).   And so, for that, I consider Mr. Childres certainly a budding designer of note, and I believe he has created a game that is worthy of its excited following. My hope is that as Isaac explores further designs--that he branches off from the fiddly (oh, how I hate that word, but alas) nature of Forge War, Gloomhaven, and upcoming Founders--My hope is that he is one day able to do *more with LESS*. If Isaac were to give us a showstopper in elegant design, I can see him surely cementing his place amongst the echelon of renowed designers.   (+) Provides a challenging decision space that requires careful consideration of all of your options, forcing you to weigh the value of opportunism versus safe play.  (+) The balance in this game seems to have been carefully crafted. In no way have I felt like a scenario was completely unwinnable or unfair. In no way have I felt like I bit off more than I can chew when delving into unrelated side scenarios. (+) There is an absolute abundance of content. You WILL get what you pay for.  (-) The core mechanisms of this game are fairly uninspired. (-) The game's depth is not emergent. It finds replay value not in depth of mechanisms, but in its vast amount of content that you have to digest as you work through the campaign. Oh, and my goodness is the setup an absolute bear. (-) It is a cooperative game. Thus, there is no real competition. There are no true battles of wits. You are merely exploiting the pre-defined automa to puzzle through one scenario after another.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "adebisi", "rating": "7", "comment": "As of this writing Gloomhaven has reached the number one spot here on Boardgamegeek. There sure are a lot of positive roleplaying vibes to the game and having the legacy mechanic introduced as character development is a nice touch. The rules basically allow for you to own the game and play the whole campaign with several different people without everyone having a need to commit to the game 100%. New/random players can just pick a new character at the level of the rest of the party which is good because the game is huge and there is so much to explore that it is unlikely that you can have the same people with you through the whole campaign. In a sense the initial impression made me think of the video game Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim because Gloomhaven has a similar sandbox feel to it. There is the main storyline but you are not tied to follow it since you may venture to all these side quests.   So, the story seems interesting enough although I am a bit worried that all these side quests draw too much attention from the main plot. But does Gloomhaven play well\u2026 Honestly, set up is a real pain and you have to make a serious effort just to have the components organised in any sensible manner. Game/battle mechanics are interesting if a tad awkward. Having a 90% deterministic battle mechanic makes clearing a dungeon to drag quite a bit as players can spend a considerable amount of time to min-max the damage input/output. You also have several card decks, monsters and influence tracks to manage. Personally I would have preferred to replace the combat modifier decks with dice just to make the decisions faster. Moreover having fewer but stronger monsters would have reduced the amount of micromanaging.   A lot of people like to compare Gloomhaven and Kingdom Death: Monster. Having tried them both, the initial impression is in favour of the latter. Gloomhaven is easier to get to play as there are no minis to assemble but the first few chapters of the narrative are not as engaging as is KD:M. In addition, the game mechanics in Gloomhaven force you to spend much more time on micromanaging the components and (sub)optimising instead of just following your instinct. But this is not to say Gloomhaven is a bad game. In contrary, I enjoy playing it and can hardly wait for the next session. But admittedly it is more of character development and exploration than of traditional board gaming. It just happens to utilise boardgame mechanics as means to deliver the experience. If you manage to see past the obvious shortcomings of Gloomhaven as a boardgame and embrace the story, I am sure the game has lots to offer.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "ljtrigirl", "rating": "7", "comment": "I do get why this game is so hyped and have enjoyed it, but there are a few elements that have made it drop down in my ratings. I LOVE the Legacy elements and the character building. I think that the way that experience and secret missions work create some not great tension and situations in games. A few examples are listed below.  My character (the mage ice girl thing) seems to get experience way faster than everyone else, so I'm causing the game to level ahead of everyone else, and I don't think that we can keep up with the overall difficulty being higher than than the average level.  You can get into frustrating situations where one player needs to kill vermlings but another is worried we'll lose the scenario if he doesn't and takes the kill himself. It turns into an almost arms race of \"you screwed me over for the sake of victory, so I'm going to do it to you\".  Money isn't shared and there's no way to trade items or money, so the tankier melee characters seem to just get less money because they need to be in specific places to hit things while the ranged characters can collect coins easily while still using their abilities. Combined with my mage's experience game, my character is much stronger than the rest of my party because I've gotten more money and experience than the rest of them every scenario.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

And of course it's a great big sprawling mess on the table.  Played through three scenarios so far. More luck than the \"euro\" tag would indicate; the Null and 2x modifiers can play a huge role. I'm unsure if I'll keep using them in RAW format. The core card play mechanism troubles me, as there is no downside to playing slow/powerful cards, provided you can pair them with fast cards; this feels thematically off, and it reduces tension (decisions become much easier).  Biggest fear at this point is that it's really a grind at heart. Character progression is very slow, which exacerbates that. Certainly doesn't hold a candle to Mage Knight, but for something different, a campaign or two will hopefully be worth the time spent.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "SamLL", "rating": "7", "comment": "Played probably 30 missions of this. It's pretty fun in general. The missions are pretty same-y and the \"power curve\" of an individual mission can be a little depressing as my character falls apart. The most satisfying part is leveling up and that is very rare. Impressive in scope, but not as entertaining as Descent.   The Legacy aspects aren't that compelling. The story doesn't really make sense or stick together - after getting back together with a week or two between games, none of us ever remember what was going on (unlike, say, Pandemic Legacy). However, I found myself thinking about it more and enjoying it more as we unlocked more characters and updated the rating a few points. It was at least compelling enough for us to want to continue.  Game balance is very shaky. The classes have extremely different power ranges. \"Eclipse\" is notably unfun in how overpowered and non-interactive it is. To handle this, the players choose their own difficulty level, so the responsibility for game balance is kind of offloaded onto you.  One of the retirement rewards, \"Envelope X\", is a puzzle/scavenger hunt that I have to imagine can only be fun or rewarding for a very small fraction of the player base. It's presented like a prominent, important part of the game (maybe even the main goal, since that has not been made clear to us 30+ missions in). Our team spoiled ourselves on it and agreed that it was completely impossible that we ever would have solved it. Seems like poor design.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "detarame", "rating": "7", "comment": "This is a game that you are absolutely going to screw up multiple rules questions for at least two or three games.  Most of the complaints seem to be that the card-based tactical element is the real weakness. Honestly, the card-and-board interaction is just fine with me. I find the tension of watching your options shrink as you lose cards and push forward to be a very flavorful mechanic that really fits the theme.   Like all really dense co-op tactical games, this this is really, really fiddly. I also think there is a lot of needless complexity baked in. In addition to bookkeeping your own character on a pen and paper character sheet, you also track a pen and paper party character sheet, as well as a large \"world map\" gameboard that largely exists to be a decoration after the game is over, I guess. Road and City events are another thing that adds very little to the experience except for occasionally getting to tear up cards.   It's the heaviest and best made game of it's type, if you're willing to put in the sweat equity and really like that sort of game I could see where it would be very, very appealing, but it is not even close to a 9.0 except maybe against the fields of exactly this game type.   Lots of comparisons to \"playing D&D without a DM.\" As a lifelong DM, it would almost certainly just be easier to learn Dungeons and Dragons.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

I think the game starts slow, but gets exciting when you know your character and get some better gear. I am definitely looking forward to continuing the campaign. The art and world building is also very fun and different than the standard fantasy tropes. My only complaint about the gameplay is that while the combat is exciting, innovative and very strategic, the story and character progression is slow and plodding. I couldnt care less about the adventure or what comes next. I just care about the next box or item I get to unlock. Individual scenarios are really fun, but I've not gotten the feeling that they really come together to be more even after >15 missions.   Also the components are mediocre, with many cardboard chits and room tiles peeling the surfaces off. Easy fix with a glue-stick, but annoying and fairly common.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "dbootz", "rating": "7", "comment": "Gloomhaven has a long set up and tear down time which prevents it from being played often.  It is also really fiddly with all of the tokens, bits and the elemental track that have to be managed each and every round.  In a multi-player scenario there is an incredible amount of little things to remember to do each and every turn (\"put this there, take that off, re-shuffle cards, apply bonuses, check conditions, etc...\") that really slows down game play.  In addition there is player elimination.  Its not the worst case of player elimination, but it does happen.                               Its still very much a dungeon crawl with most scenarios having the goal of \"Kill all the things.\"    The card play and combinations are interesting. For a game that has been described as D&D in a box, it lacks the player  involvement in developing the story and campaign.    If role playing was only about hacking up monsters, then I would agree with this comparison, but, as it is, this does not capture the full experience of role playing any more then other dungeon crawlers.  Road and City events are pretty much \"Crossroad Cards\" (ala Dead of Winter) where the consequences of the decisions you make seem random and arbitrary.   My overall reaction to this game is that it is okay, for some reason people don't seem to mind all of the things that I see as problems, and that is great for them.   So many things exist in this game that would be pointed to, in other games, as flaws (fiddly, too many bits, player elimination, on-rails narrative, etc..), but it seems to get away with all of them for many players.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

I also like the secret hidden goals, which helped to add a little tension to the game. The player character asymmetry was really interesting. The dual use of the cards (top and bottom balancing) was well designed.  DISLIKE: Lots of randomness. Possibility for player elimination. Fiddly, with little rules and modifications that players need to remember. Lots of shuffling. Not very portable. The gameplay feels like it would get repetitive with it's hack 'n slash gameplay.  OVERALL: It's a fun hybrid RPG. It reminded me a lot of Pathfinder TCG, but using miniatures instead. I enjoyed the game, although I am turned off by how much hype this game has gotten. It has a very high 'exploration' game design factor, but lacks strategic depth compared to euro-game design. Still, I found it enjoyable.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "HeadlessKurt", "rating": "7", "comment": "Enjoyable, thoughtful combat system for a dungeon crawler. Managing your hand/stamina is unique, and abilities are often fun to chain together. Two things bug me about this game enough to not rate it higher: Firstly, while chaining together combos is fun, once you discover a good combo, you often exploit it, rinse, and repeat. While it takes longer to find the combo and executing again is delayed behind the resting mechanic, your actions do become somewhat rote after a few missions. Because progression for my team has been very slow, with most people at level 5 and no new classes, we have stagnated in this loop. Secondly, and more importantly, too much of the game for me is just not playing the game. Upkeep takes a lot of time when you add everything in- marking temple payments, adding stickers to the board, marking missions completed on the board and the book, setting up for missions (which is somehow even more time consuming than Descent/IA), choosing a mission which requires a breakdown of where the team is in each quest chain and has become basically a novella that I send out every week to figure out what we should do on game night. Individually none of these are too bad, but I would say in a given week I honestly spend 1/3 of my time doing Gloomhaven-related things that are not playing Gloomhaven, and that is simply not a good enough ratio for me. Generically speaking this goes to the recent induction of video game mechanics in board games. I think someone soon will strike the perfect balance, and I'm glad games like this are trying to do so, even if it doesn't fully succeed.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "jmw23", "rating": "7", "comment": "What I like:  the cards have two uses, and also are the game timer, and also are your health (sort of).  Very clever!  I like the idea of a campaign story ladder.  The different classes feel different.  Not the same old boring fantasy classes (wizard, warrior etc.) or races.  What I don't like:  the actual game doesn't blow me away.  It feels very same-y play after play.  Enter a dungeon, kill everything.  Maybe you need to throw something in a hole instead, but you're still more or less entering a dungeon to kill everything.  Again, and again, and again.  It's fine, but I feel there's something lacking.  Warhammer Quest, a much older game, felt like it varied things up more, somehow...I like Gloomhaven OK, but definitely not as much as everyone else seems to.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

There is too little variation in the scenarios. They are all very similar. The storyline is sometimes cool but sometimes really weak. I expected a strong storytelling game with some awesome twists and an open world full of life where you can do basically everything...

{"username": "Cardboard Conundrum", "rating": "7", "comment": "Very exciting cracking into and punching out all the bits for such a gloriously over-the-top game - thanks to the parcel sticker, I now know that with hundreds of tokens, thousands of cards and a hefty campaign book for the myriad of boxed, unique classes to explore the game weighs in at an impressive 10kg. And reading through the rules and opening my first miniature etc was incredibly exciting, but I must admit I wasn't blown away by the game, albeit after one play so far. The only reason I am writing my thoughts so quickly is that I was thoroughly disappointed by another game with a misleading player count on the box. I have recently started working shifts, meaning more nights and weekends are spent working instead of gaming. I've started gaming solitaire more and more recently so I picked Gloomhaven up to be a good, meaty solo game that I could really sink my teeth into. Unfortunately the box as-sold is really a 2-4 player co-op game that can be played with a single player controlling multiple heroes, which is something I really, really hate doing in games - and if the game didn't cost me so much I would've just packed it in there and then. However, I gave it a shot and I did enjoy the game. This is a BEAST to set up and there is A LOT of upkeep for one person - playing two characters and all the AI. I am really looking forward to playing through the campaign mode now, having gotten to grips with the rules and hope my rating of the game improves given how much I've invested in it. But I found the involved set up and upkeep to be fairly significant negatives, by far overshadowed by the \"1\"-4 player count. The gameplay is good -I imagine it being great when you can just focus on your one character and the world-building seems excellent after one play. Initial impression 10/10 for over-the-top excitement and fantastic world building, and a generous 6/10 for solitaire gameplay so far - ending somewhere around 6-7/10 for me as an entire package after one play. However, this will certainly change as there is a wealth to explore in this game - and explore it I shall as I bought it to keep me company on my days off with no one to game with!", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Iantully", "rating": "7", "comment": "My wife and I play this as a 2-player setup.   Overall - I really enjoy this game. We were able to grab this as a dinged unit for like $90 and, so far, it seems to hold at least that much value.   If you're reading here, chance are you've done your research and know this game is well received by the BGG community. I won't repeat any pros/cons that i feel like are not already stated dozens of times in other places.   My biggest con - SO. MANY. PIECES. If you're like me, then you absolutely lovveee the different pieces and monsters and items and characters and YES! However, I was really shocked to realize just how much moved in every single round. You have character cards, ability cards, ability modifier cards, the modifier deck for your character, then you have each monster to track, there modifiers, individual abilities and capabilities.   It's a lot. And I was surprised. I had heard about this negative before I bought it and thought \"Oh get over it! That's what makes board gaming fun!\" Well, Gloomhaven has officially crossed my comfort level with how much to keep track of. My wife and I will be looking at the free app to minimize the setup and tracking components  My biggest pro! The story! I thought this would be just a setup and tear down move-attack-repeat kind of game. And, while it kind of is, there's a decent bit of story behind each scenario! I LOVE this. My wife and I agree this is what keeps us coming back to play the next scenario!   First impressions is a solid 7-8/10 stars.  I'll update as the campaign progresses!  ---- *Update 2 weeks later  5 scenarios into the game - definitely go for the app if you're becoming hesitant to play the game because of having to keep track of all the health and monsters - it speeds up the play time significantly will still leaving plenty of components to manipulate to feel like a typical boardgame.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Wizniz13", "rating": "7", "comment": "Gloomhaven is a wonderful game in many ways. At a high price point you can have an entire yearlong campaign in one big fat box. You could literally buy this game and never need to be another for a solid year. There is that much content and replayability offered.    The components are of high quality. The art and colors on the card pop right out to the eye.  I especially love the art for the class decks.  There is a perfect mixture of pastel and rich, dark colors.    The story campaign seems to be fairly open.  You can tread down different scenario paths each with unique impacts on the overarching story.   I especially love the combat decks. To me, they are the shining light on Gloomhaven. Each class can modify their combat deck with new cards through upgrades. My brute can add pierce 3 cards, target cards or a +3 modifier one. Whereas my Mindthief can add a cold element +2 modifier, remove up to four -1 cards and add stun effect cards. It\u2019s like being able to personally modify your own d20 roll for each class when you use the combat decks- especially since you can have less or more than 20 cards.   I\u2019ve played over 50 games of Gloomhaven solo and I\u2019ll be honest- I\u2019ve treated it as a true legacy game. I tear up my cards when they tell me to, I ink on the game board when I complete a scenario.  I run the stickers on extra tight and I cross off treasure checks as I loot them. I have no intention of replaying my current box of Gloomhaven. When I do that I\u2019ll jusy buy another box.   I have a few issues with the game  but they are some major sticklers. Within my box the print color variations are pretty drastic. When I\u2019ve upgraded my Brute some of the modifier deck cards are darker in color. This allows me to see when drawing whether the card is one of the upgraded ones or one of the starter cards. This drives me nuts. You\u2019d be surprised how hard it is to find European mini card sleeve that have colored backs- you basically can\u2019t. I ended up using my Heroes of Land, Air and Sea spell card sleeves as they have a green back.   The rules suggest that when playing solo that you increase the scenario level by one. This makes it brutally hard to win scenarios. The reason behind this is because the game was designed where you aren\u2019t suppose to communicate detailed tactics with one another whereas in solo play you obviously do.  I find it hard to wrap my head around how you can actually design a game harder just by not allowing the players to hammer out a turn with one another.   Personally- I play the first five scenarios at the normal level and then bumped up each scenario by one level as per the rules. This seems to have worked out okay with only a .33 chance to fail each mission.  I also find the concept very stressful where you become exhausted when you lose all of your cards out of play. Each time you rest you cycle out one of your cards out of play. You only have ten or so cards to play with so this can happen pretty quickly. Take into the fact that you also can become exhausted when your hitpoint total reaches zero.  The avoid this you can discard a random card in your hand or a whopping 2 cards in your discard to nullify the damage taken- no matter how much was inflicted. This game mechanic seems to be like a diminishing returns aspect that I don\u2019t particularly like.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "techz7", "rating": "7", "comment": "I think that Gloomhaven is a fantastic game, with solid mechanics and a ton of longevity for what you get in the box, while there are downsides, some of them you can get around and even with the remaining ones, it is still a fantastic game worth playing.  things to know:  - I played with the same group over the course of roughly once a week 1-2 scenarios a week for about a year. - after playing with the cards for a handful of scenarios, I quickly found using an app or web-app well worth it (I used an ipad and put it onto the tv with airplay). the gloomhaven guild web app and the gloomhaven helper app are well worth it. - for organization, I ended up just doing plano boxes (because I had them around) for the monsters and small map tiles, a expandable folio for map tiles and the broken token character trays. If I started another campaign, I would likely buy a full insert so that the game could be contained in the actual box. - Dear god, print yourself a campaign sheet to keep track of achievements, unlocked scenarios, prosperity etc, the board is honestly unnecessary (although I think it is kind of nice thematically to see your world expanding as you put scenario stickers on it) - We did try to keep as much spoiler free as possible, so when choosing scenarios, not looking at rewards or even the contents of a dungeon.   pros: - The hand management/action mechanic is great, I love the choices it causes you to have to make and it feels pretty solid. - The classes are great, I love how different each of them are and how exciting it feels to open a new one. - the scenarios are fun, even the ones that are kill all of the monsters. - longevity, holy cow. This game has a ton of longevity in the box. - monster AI feels well done.  neutral: - event cards: The event cards eventually devolved into us just trying to game for the better outcome because we had seen it before, it never really felt like you were making choices as your character because it never really felt like your character had a ton of 'personality' outside of the race/class description which didn't feel like it gave you much, your choices even then didn't feel like they were really all that impacting on the future events themselves. - scenario lockouts: One of the things I found is that it often felt like scenarios were locked out for inscrutable reasons, which kinda felt like a bummer (yes, I know we could do them in casual play).  - campaign direction: Often it felt like the story lacked direction and choosing a scenarios was often was just us looking at a list of the ones we haven't completed and saying \"do you guys wanna do this?\" and then checking pre-reqs. The time between unlocking them and doing them partially by choosing other scenarios or just because time between sessions, so often most of the through line was, \"oh hey, I vaguely remember something about this place or person being mentioned.\"  cons: - organization: this game almost requires you buy an organizer either plano boxes and expandable file folio or something like the broken token in order to get setup/put away in any reasonable amount of time - setup: when playing with just the components in the box, setup can take quite a bit of time. - monster management (not AI): the monster management using their cards for hit points and status effects feels so fiddly and a real pain to deal with, if you don't end up using an app to manage those, at least get yourself bulk d6-20's dice and use those for HP. - Summon AI: summons felt incredibly weak or even useless sometimes, because of the lack of player control, it often felt like they were just running ahead and killing themselves, or ended up being too far behind and playing catch-up with limited movement the whole time. - Ending up DMing and playing: something that happened in my group and I read about often happening was that one person effectively becomes the DM while playing. It usually becomes the person who understands monster AI the best. While you can split up duties, managing monster AI, health and status effects, deck. It can still feel draining to be that player. - life goals.... some of them felt really achievable, and some of them felt like out of game life goals, because you were going to retire yourself before you were going to complete them. For one of my characters, the 3 other players in my party retired a total of 5 or 6 different classes between my picking up my second one and retiring it, because of that, it felt like I was stuck and bored before we finally were able to unlock something I could even do a casual re-play to finish it", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Ibaimendi", "rating": "7", "comment": "I don't love this game the way that lots of people love it, but it's pretty solid. A couple things that are interesting about it: 1) The way that the action cards work; being able to do one top action and one bottom action both provides a lot of options and constrains what you can actually do. 2) The magic trick the game somehow pulls off, where it feels like you are absolutely hosed, you are dying ignominiously, but then, somehow, you pull out a win. This doesn't happen every time, but most of the time.  So it can be pretty fun, especially with the more interesting scenarios.  Sometimes the scenarios can feel a little samey, and with two players, you don't get to see as many characters as you like, but it's a good game with a few brilliant moments. (I still don't understand what the board is for, though. Couldn't it be replaced by a checklist, like the ones for the characters and the party? Was this a kickstarter stretch goal or something?)

If ever there was a game that was BEGGING for an app, this was it. Its a shame there wasn't one shipped w/ the game that could have cut down on the number of fiddly things to keep track of. I do enjoy this game, but I find it tiresome to remember all the things going on in it, and I think it's a little too much for my gaming group. Plus I am absolutely baffled by why they thought it needed to ship w/ this many components instead of just making expansions after the fact.

My main holdup is whether this is something I'm actually going to play often enough to make it worth the cost, keeping in mind that aside from my #1 (which Gloomhaven will not displace), I play my favorite games at most 20 times a year.  On the other hand $5 a play over the course of a year (and more to come) isn't an unreasonable amount. Hmmmm.  I tried this out single player (driving two characters), and while it's an okay challenge to just take out some characters and do the dungeon crawl / XP grind alone I suspect the game is much more fun at two or three. Four might slow it down a little too much, but the main decision point is made simultaneously so maybe it'll be okay.  Update 2019-02-01: I think it's pretty clear this campaign isn't going to get finished.

It reminds me a bit of mage knight. You select the actions you want to perform each turn but your choices gets more limited as time goes on.  The choices for the legacy part of the game seems arbitrary and not story driven.  You are asked to make random decisions on encounters and you get random results.  Also some of the components are little questionable, especially the health and XP markers.   The way you mark the damages is also incredibly fiddly, there has to be a better way than just putting a bunch of small chits in a tiny area. The game sounds great but the actual experience is average.  It's a good game but not sure if it lives up to all the hype.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

I feel the combat too abstract and repetitive. The storytelling/campaign mode is quite simple, despite the sandbox possibilities are quite impressive. Scenarios design as, as far as I've played (8 scenarios so far), quite poor. Almost everything is about killing enemies. Long set up. By the other hand, plays are interesting from a tactical perspective, and once you're in the heat of the moment it's fun. But I think that in a game with all those possibilities of storytelling, campaign, adventuring, character development, etc, it's a shame that none of them really shines.

Character classes are superb and not the usual Cleric, Paladin etc Negatives: Combat is very slow and even with experience I cannot think that you would get a room done in less than 45 minutes. The tile artwork is bland. Not much terrain etc. and not at Descent standards. Overall: It does take Descent to the next level with character development but the town stuff is the same level, the artwork worse and the slow progress makes it feel a real slog.

{"username": "Edgecrusher100", "rating": "6", "comment": "Only 1 play so far and it was fun. I really enjoy the hand management and how it's tied into the end game (built in clock). I've played several campaign based, cooperative dungeon crawls including Mice and Mystics, Temple of Elemental Evil and Imperial Assault and this is the best (IA will give this a run though once the app is out and you can play completely cooperatively).  With the above in mind, I had a couple of opportunities to purchase this and didn't as it's not a good fit for me now. There's no way I could get through all of the content and, in general, I don't like cooperative games as much as competitive... so if I were to get this it would be for solo play as it wouldn't be my first choice to play 40+ cooperative sessions. Component quality is OK and setup appears to be a bit difficult. The story looks like it could be quite engaging, but not for occasional play, would need to commit to play the game out. I can definitely see people who like cooperative campaign games liking this one, but I think there's a little hype pumping up the ratings. I put this at a 7, it's a good game and I wouldn't mind occasionally sitting in a session but not something I would buy (maybe when my son gets older).", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Rumbelow", "rating": "6", "comment": "starts out really slow for a group of beginners. the tactical dungeon crawling is pretty fun, but after a while begins to feel a little like Pandemic. it's like you're going through your deck and eventually you'll hit a moment you have to rest, even if you're not 100% ready. still, you can predict it just like watching the deck in Pandemic thin out expecting an Epidemic. but is a Rest really comparable to an Epidemic? depends on the group's situation, but often you're either stranded far away, hurting for a heal, or stranded by monsters. sometimes all three at once. it's not the end of the world, but the group is going to have to work around this and hope it doesn't lead to some sort of cascade or outbreak of negative consequences. this tension is pretty sweet, but it never translated to character growth to me. the group pulled through, not me. upgrades are often incremental or specific to a situation i don't know if i can plan to expect. whatever, these are going to feel like poor arguments to the crowd who are still drooling over this game. if you like what you've seen elsewhere then by all means get it. it has bits which will appeal to both co-op gamers and dungeon crawl veterans alike. i just want to stress that this is a hybrid game and may feel weak in some areas. but, i definitely hope you get a chance to play someone else's copy for a bit! oh, and if you were wondering, the legacy bit feels like it only adds to the game experience. i believe you WILL get your money's worth if you play this to the end.

{"username": "Eeeville", "rating": "6", "comment": "Gloomhaven gets a 6 out of respect. The end.  Just kidding. There are some huge issues I have with the game despite how much respect I have for the designer and everything involved with this game. What are my problems? Here we go:  1) I would rather be playing a SRPG such as Tactics Ogre, Final Fantasy Tactics, or Shining Force than this game. I understand it takes away from the bringing together of friends, but I have plenty of other games for that. I would rather have everything automated for me for this style of game. More on that later...  2) This game is a huge monstrosity. You need to make/purchase a storage solution before you can really begin playing this game. The ones you can purchase are just shy of  the price of the actual game itself, which is not cheap either (though, you get your money's worth for the game). The game also takes up a lot of room on the shelf! Know this before you buy the game.  3) The rules are tricky. They are not terribly hard, but there is a test you can take on the Gloomhaven forums to see how well you understand monster movement. Let's just say I didn't understand them. In fact, a lot of people did poorly according to the polls. While it's admirable that the designer has a living FAQ of the game, you need to reference this FAQ to find things that are not in the rulebook.  4) This is a personal preference, but I really didn't like the slow progression of your character in this game. I understand that it's a legacy game and that's kind of the point, but I guess I'm spoiled by non-legacy games that have faster character progression in a single play.  Anyway, I'm sure many people have gushed about why they like this game. So, I'm not going to discuss it's merits. I respect the design, but I'll probably never play it again for the above reasons.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "leffe dubbel", "rating": "6", "comment": "Gloomhaven is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives. Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for travelling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.  This is a game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a \u201cChoose Your Own Adventure\u201d book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.  Essentially, every turn a player will play two cards out of their hand. Each card has a number at the top, and the number on the first card played will determine their initiative order. Each card also has a top and bottom power, and when it is a player\u2019s turn in the initiative order, they determine whether to use the top power of one card and the bottom power of the other, or vice-versa. Players must be careful, though, because over time they will permanently lose cards from their hands. If they take too long to clear a dungeon, they may end up exhausted and be forced to retreat.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The using of the 2 cards to set up your next action, together with the extra deck of cards that tell you if you do more or less the damage your cards told you that you do. The multiple different uses you can have for cards... I know this is all there to improve the possibilities, but somehow the options of the cards still felt pretty restrictive. Especially as you could but couldn't really communicate with your team before choosing the cards to set up?  If that text sounds a bit confusing... well, it's because it can be confusing, or rather, feel a bit chaotic. I did understand the rules, but they didn't feel \"there\" yet. Could be that this was simply because of the demo mission we were playing, in which we get tought nothing of the legacy kind of board, about the upgrading system and about improving your chances.  For now, it feels like a euro rpg and nothing all that special (except the big box... that thing is huge!)", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "fixpix", "rating": "6", "comment": "It's an ok game but it's way over hyped. Definitely not the miracle game everyone is raving about. I'm looking at the ratings in disbelief, there must be something I'm missing here. I love dungeon crawlers so typically I'd be the first to rate this a 10.  The campaign portion lacks severely in terms of events, which are laughable for most part, with obvious choices. In the long run there\u2019s almost no incentive to take the \u2018bad\u2019 option so it all feels scripted. Thematically this is no better than standard D&D. Classes and races seem to be the same in practice, only different in terminology. Scenario design is really poor, with 80% of them about killing everything on the map, leaving most games feeling sameish.  The meat of the game, the tactical combat is a good in terms of player agency, monsters and characters diversity but I'm not a big fan of the main mechanic, deck exhaustion. I get it mechanically and thematically, it's not a fun thing to do. It feels like an increasing slog and it gets repetitive very fast. Going back to redo a scenario because you ran out of cards or luck in the previous attempt is indescribably boring. This is particularly frustrating in scenarios where it's obvious bouts of good draws are needed to win. Overall, I much prefer Mage Knight, where your experience of the game ramps up as you play the game. Or Descent, where the game progresses whether you won the scenario or not. Speaking of Descent, I don't see the combat decks as a vast improvement over dice, which are faster to resolve while providing similar results.  I\u2019m perplexed to see how many people praise it for it\u2019s euro qualities. Couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. The battle decks make it so that any plans you can possibly come up with can be completely undone by a bad draw. The \u201cmiss\u201d cards actually resets the deck so instead of providing smoother results, it makes battle just as swingy as dice. I hated them from the first play, but I understand that without them, there aren\u2019t that many exciting moments, which is probably why I\u2019m not that interested in the game.   I may be wrong judging the game by the first couple of scenarios but at 2 hours average per attempt, I don't feel the need to try any more.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Gryfon", "rating": "6", "comment": "Gloomhaven is decent, but I think the time investment required to play a campaign is better spent on other games.  In particular, I would get more enjoyment playing a game of Mage Knight, experiencing the whole level-up/treasure thing in 4 hours, rather than playing 12 hours of Gloomhaven to go up a level or two.

Very over rated so far, and I bought it with a great deal of excitement. My friends love it though. Really though if I wanted to play some cool combos with a pair of cards, and be done in a quarter of the time I'd play Battlecon, which is quite similar with it's attack pairs, and card based initiative, but with far more variety and skill.

On the other hand, the strategy introduced by the card play may make it more enjoyable. Dunno.  The legacy side allows for a kind of 'choose your own adventure' style to the  overall campaign, which is cute, but damages replay value (without modified stickers or tracking sheets)  I find the campaign 'flavor' is not sufficient to justify this presentation.

{"username": "Scooperman", "rating": "6", "comment": "Seven games in and the lustre is beginning to wear off as the game has revealed itself to be a grind rather than an adventure.  There is a distinct lack of memorable moments and no puzzle solving as each scenario so far has resolved as room/fight/door/room/fight/door/room/fight etc. until the party wins or runs away in defeat.  The story being played out feels to be of little consequence as the game simply sets up yet another horde to hack and slash through.  The gameplay drags too, that moment when I see how little distance has been covered on the maps due to the laborious bookkeeping and calculations for the monsters is a disappointment, and only enhances the feeling of the grind.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Andy Parsons", "rating": "6", "comment": "Gloomhaven is yet another very big box of stuff.  It differs from, say, Conan in that the contents of the box are all about extended play value (90+ scenarios, character development and a legacy element) rather than the wow factor of massed plastic.  Gloomhaven is yet another dungeon crawler.  It differs from, say, Descent by not requiring someone to play the dungeon master.  I can see that in a game so strongly focused on character development, no one is going to want to miss out on that - even if only for one session - to represent the bad guys.  Gloomhaven tries hard with its non-player characters, giving different types their own decks of action cards.  Nonetheless, they too often do stupid things.  Gloomhaven is yet another dungeon crawler whose scenarios can take several hours to complete.  In this, it infringes my rule of dungeon crawlers, which is that if it takes more than an hour, then I'd rather be doing some proper role-playing that goes beyond killing things, grabbing loot and gaining experience.    Characters' actions are driven by personal decks, with each card offering two different actions.  Each turn you choose two cards, selecting one top and one bottom action.  The optimum combination to use in a given situation is seldom available, so how to cobble together something effective? When best to play that one use ability?  Unlike many dungeon crawlers, Gloomhaven gives you plenty to think about.    Production quality and artwork are both decent.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Rules are a bit complicated - some of the stuff could easily have been removed without affecting anything seriously. Beeing cooperative you can skip a lot and it's quite easy to teach others to play if you stick to the basics. Setup time is far to long though. There are lots of components (tons of stuff that's only used once) but variation is still quite low - each game is very similar to the previous one, making it slightly boring after a while.

{"username": "GMTemplar", "rating": "6", "comment": "At first I thought the game is excellent. However, after a dozen or so games it started to lose gaming time. Gloomhaven is not like traditional dungeon crawlers. It actually reminds much more of Diablo, Torchlight or Path of Exile - digital co-op hack'n'slash games, nominally called action RPGs. The key to winning is ability combos, much like in the previous titles.  The deciding drawback to me was that there is no downside to losing a scenario. You can just have another go. This removes all tension and suspense.  The fantasy world is very generic and we found ourselves not really caring about the plot details. Cardboard monsters don't really do it to me either. I would have rather had plastic miniatures at triple the cost of the game.  Sold my copy and will probably play the PC version when it is launched.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

All in all, my biggest gripe is that it\u2019s simply not better than most good dungeon crawls for a high price point, difficult storage, and abusive handling time between games.

Lots of good ideas, it's just not for me.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

I understand it's an \"estimate\". But you would think that the second time around they would come \"somewhat\" close their the estimated date? It looks like it's not going to arrive until November (if all \"goes well\").  So, this rating isn't even from my, yet to arrive, kick-started copy.  It's from playing with a different copy with some friends.  Moving on.  I've edited and erased most of my review because BGUser: Poptech posted a extensive review that hits on all the issues I have with game. And is much more eloquent then I am.  Suffice to say, I own 500+ board games and this game is the so over-hyped, and so underwhelming, it's baffling.  This is the kind of game that greatly reinforces the term ameritrash.  So much stuff in the box but so little in the way of cohesive, intelligent game-play.    ", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Need more elves & pirates.  If you combined together the best card mechanics from Gloomhaven and Mage Knight, supplied one hundred properly sculpted miniatures and presented the campaign set in an engaging non-generic universe then I\u2019d be inclined to feel engaged in the game experience. Gloomhaven is a generously sized package filled with surprises which included a lack of attention to detail in two fundamental areas; 1. Quality miniature sculpting 2. Forgetting to bring talented fantasy artists in to illustrate all its blank cards and other mundane components. Gloomhaven is even more plain than its unimaginative title suggests. I\u2019d always prefer to be adventuring in somewhere drenched in tomes of arcane lore that mattered. Somewhere like Mordheim.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Lofski", "rating": "6", "comment": "The game is fairly well designed overall. However, the campaign is extremely long, and character development very slow.  The way looting works would require very seamless cooperation between players, or otherwise anyone playing a character who isn't good at looting won't be able to afford many items, let alone enhancements.  Almost all scenarios have \"kill everything\" as an objective. The ones that don't are mostly either way too easy to win or practically fall back to killing everything.  Scenarios are usually so easy on normal difficulty that it's boring, but sometimes there is a monster that will wreck your party if you increase the difficulty. For this reason, better balancing of the monsters would have been good.  All the above issues together make the game kind of repetitive quickly. If this was the only board game out there, I'd be happily playing the campaign til the end, but there are many other good games to play rather than grinding this to completion.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Mystic_Mouse", "rating": "6", "comment": "Gloomhaven has some great card strategy and deck building elements, but it is initially very slow and suffers from repetitiveness.  I initially did not like my first few games due to overly simple plots and limited variety.  The story and strategy grew on me, but over time I would call this game samey in a way that many will hate.  It plays pretty similar to Mage Knight, but simpler, so if you like solving card puzzles with deck timers, this will be the game for you.  They're different enough for some people to buy both, but I'd play this with a group before purchasing if you think this is going to play like an RPG like AD&D; it is not.  There are a plethora of scenarios to play, but they are relatively samey.  Get in quick, kill, and repeat.  The game is expensive, but they jam a lot into the box.  There's a great variety of monsters and dungeon tiles.  An organizer for setup and tear down is a good investment.    Mechanically, this is a card management strategy game.  You can only slightly deck-build compared to LCGs, but there's a decent variety between the characters.  There are enemy AIs, but again, many feel samey.  The narrative is less hit than miss, which is unfortunate, but an imaginative group can add a lot with a little role-play. The worst elements to the game are that unlocking cards, new characters, and equipment is very slow compared to many games.  If the prosperity didn't allow new characters to start at higher levels, I would easily house-rule it, because the starting characters drudge along painfully.  I'd start newbies at level 3 to avoid them disliking the game.  Seriously, I don't see how people don't complain more about this!  The brilliant part of this game is the ability to control the balance of the game no matter the number of, or change out, of players; a variable player group will get this to the table more than most campaign games.  The best player count really depends on the individuals.  Similar to Mage Knight, there are times where players may have dozens of choices and slow the course of play.     The Gloomhaven character progression is too slow and game-play too repetitive for me to vote higher, but this game could be great in the right group that invests in unwritten narratives and just has fun in coop games.  If you find the game samey, I'd start at level 3 and open more items for purchase faster (open all normal items).  That will create more freedom and change in the strategy. Once you're at higher levels (5+), you can build more complicated decks, and the play opens up.  With a full complement of good gear and blessings from the city, you're pretty powered up. I enjoyed the increase in deck-, play- and scenario-options once I gave this game a dozen plays.    I don't really care for the art, the lack of art on the cards, or the programming that can waste cards just because someone else takes your action first.  I'm also getting annoyed with rushing through every quest just to fit the way the card management works.  It didn't bother me at first, but when you realize that you're going to repeat a dungeon, and you still have to finish out the play for the experience points, it becomes tedious to me.  I'm glad this game exists, but surprised at the ratings it gets compared to LCGs.  Dingo", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}
{"username": "Damion Schubert", "rating": "6", "comment": "It's all right.  Slightly better than 'meh'.  The good: diceless tactical game.  AI for creatures is novel and interesting, and keeps things on your toes.  The sense of scale to the worldbuilding is immense, and the resulting world is well done.  This game could replace D&D for a group that plays D&D for the combat instead of the roleplaying.  The overarching campaign and how that's handled is well done.  The bad: still prone to the problems of most tactical games, namely strict analysis paralysis.  The shrinking hand mechanic means your entire group can be screwed over by random link.

The progress is too slow (three scenarios to go up a level), and in fact you don't feel such a difference. The scenarios feel more or less all the same, a slogging match with artificial competition mechanics, with little space for problem solving, unlike, for instance, Pandemic Legacy. After a scenario that dragged for 7 hours, we decided to stop the campaign...  Below is my old  evaluation, after playing 3 times.  I think that this game is overrated at 9.0. While it has interesting card mechanics to regulate character actions, from the perfect 10 score I have to discount:  1 point for the absurd setup and clean up time; 1 point for the forced artificial competitive mechanics that detract from group enjoyment of a cooperative game (you can see it in Pandemic Legacy for example), and for the stupid rule that you can't get the treasure after killing the monsters... 1 point for the complicated bookeeping that delays a lot the game...  and so I end up with a score of 7.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

We started our campaign with one more player, D&D expert player who said many things are familiar to him. The scenario was really really tough, we were almost sure to lose and we managed to win with 3 exhausted character. I really liked the tension and the fingerbiting finale, the fact that I understood many important things about my character (MindThief).  The time for a single scenario is still very very long, too long if I think about playing almost a hundred scenarios. ---------- [20180323] A lot of mixed feelings so far. I read comments with rating 10 and I agree with them. I read comments with rating 4 and I also agree with them! It takes a lot of time to understand, to prepare, to tear down and I just barely went through the first room of a random scenario, just to understand how it works. Yes, it takes too much time, at least at the moment. I hope it gets faster and faster with more experience.  I fear it will be always the same experience again and again and I hope it will, instead, give me every time a different feeling.

{"username": "Sir Masher", "rating": "6", "comment": "TL;DR: Amazing design, progression and story but just not that fun to actually play solo and not practical for most people's lives.  So hard to score this game.  Mechanically and thematically the game is fantastic. Hell, I even loved the flavour text, leveling mechanics, branching story paths and how events can lead to good or bad consequences later in the game!  But here's the problem: The mechanics don't suit the length of the campaign.  I love long, thinky, heavy, puzzly games like Mage Knight, the Mistfall series and even Unicornus Knights. But you sit down for a few hours and play them ONCE! Then you're free to pack them up or reset, change characters/scenarios and play again.  Mage Knight is my favourite game but I wouldn't want to have to play it 75+ times to complete a campaign and after about a dozen plays it's starting to feel like an obligation rather than some fun for a few hours.  But I LOVE CAMPAIGNS!! It's just that I think I prefer campaigns for games that are lighter. Games like WarhammerQuest ACG, Descent 2nd Ed, Pathfinder ACG, Sword & Sorcery etc where combat can be streamlined with a quick dice-chuck and some clever card play to mitigate the risk of poor luck  I think I'd prefer this game to either be a dice chucker and keep the campaign OR Keep it the way it is but have the Set up, tear down, leveling and campaign tracking simplified and streamlined.   POSITIVES +Brilliant tactical combat +I'm really enjoying the story so far +Character boxes/envelopes are great for storing active/locked/retired heroes +Satisfying leveling system +Shop/prosperity system +Variety in Characters +Battle and life goals really impact how you play and decisions you make not only in the scenario but during road and city events or even how you spend your money +Removing/adding heroes to the party is pretty easy +Gameplay is pretty intuitive once you've got the hang of it +Lots of 'Kill Everything' scenarios which I love   NEGATIVES -Game is too heavy for a campaign so long/Campaign is too long for a game so heavy -Scenarios take too long to have a group of adults be able to commmit to the campaign. And if they do, they're likely going to want to play an RPG instead. -Solo experience is great but takes away from playing other games -Box insert is great for shipping but absolutely useless for keeping a campaign organised (except for character boxes-they're great!) -Had to spend a small fortune on various folders organisers to be able top keep track of my campaign  WORTH NOTING: I have a games room with a table and storage dedicated to Gloomhaven including folders, boxes and even a craft table that fits underneath so it keeps everything organised. I even have a magnetic whiteboard with magnetised map stickers. map and an A3 sized party sheet to record where I'm at. Now I understand that not many people have this luxury but let me put it this way: If I didn't, I WOULD NOT KEEP IT. Seriously, you're not going to get you money's worth if, over the course of a campaign, you don't want to spend DOZENS of hours setting up and re-organising. This game needs its OWN TABLE and storage system.  I normally find setting up a board game oddly relaxing. Not Gloomhaven. I dread the set up-even with all the organisational luxuries that I have and have mentioned.  When I do play I have a GREAT time!!! But when it's over and I realise how much work is now ahead of me. It's worth it at the moment in my opinion however I can completely understand anyone who abandons this game after a few sessions.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The game is a beast with some major toy factor in the minis, but the tiles are a snooze.   It has some interesting mechanics. Unfortunately, many of them mechanics become a bore when your character has few if any meaningful choices to make. Sacrifice yourself and be eliminated or the whole party dies is not a choice in a cooperative game.

{"username": "InventoryAccount", "rating": "6", "comment": "It's fine. The game is reasonably compelling, if a little fiddly (and I say that as a wargamer). The writing is decent veering to poor on occasion. I am in charge of reading out fluff in my games with my brother, and there have been a few times I've stopped reading to gather myself before continuing with some pretty purple prose.  The contention that you can build your own storyline is pretty weak. From what we've seen so far, the choices are pretty obvious. Do nice things, and nice things generally happen to you. Do bad things, and bad things generally happen to you. Because the writing can be pretty anemic, it also has the downside of being forgettable. We regularly forget what was going on the last time we played, and storyline choices (i.e. to help or hinder the early game cult) seemed pretty nonsensical.  The tactical puzzles are entertaining, and leveling up is a lot of fun. Gloomhaven also does a great job of maintaining a sense of tension from the start of a scenario to the finish. You never really feel comfortable.  All in all, I think it's reasonable. I think it could have been much smaller and cheaper with almost no loss.

{"username": "ozradio", "rating": "6", "comment": "I played the first three scenarios 2-3 times each. This was my first tactical fighting game and in the end I thought it was okay. I had a table to leave it out on that helped but all the upkeep and bookkeeping was not for me. Mainly I discovered tactical games aren't my thing and that's the bulk of Gloomhaven's gameplay. If you have the time and space and interest in this game style I can totally see how you could get absorbed in this game. I'd be willing to do a drop-in scenario every now and then but that's it.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Now that we're like 4 months into a campaign with something like 40 scenarios down, I'm really starting to get tired of the game.  It's amazing, yes, and there's a lot of great moving parts to it.  However, it's very much the same thing, over and over again.  You unlock a character, get psyched about new abilities, then grind through rooms in dungeons.  Every scenario is 3 rooms with 3-6 monster types, and you have anywhere from 11-15 rounds to finish it.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "jellospike", "rating": "6", "comment": "This game deserves its reputation as the most EPIC board game ever made. There is just so much of everything: characters to play, monsters to fight, quests to do, etc. The campaign is ridiculously long and feels like a RPG saga without a GM.  However, the core of this game is nothing especially great: the dungeons feel overlong and sometimes tedious, the setup and \"AI\" monster activation are fiddly and take too much time and effort, the card-driven actions are overly abstract, un-immersive and often frustrating, and despite the lack of dice, the game often feels random.  Furthermore, the RPG-like story is bland and disjoined, the presentation and artwork is average at best and there feels like there is little real incentive to win, since the game's difficulty \"adjusts\" to your successes and failings. The multiple individualist mechanisms feel weird and unwelcome in a cooperative game.  Despite all of this, Gloomhaven is still a pretty special experience, and the legacy aspects keep the game intriguing. Other games, such as Descent (despite its flaws) give a more thrilling and satisfying dungeon experience and other games like Mansions of Madness and Arkham Horror, are more amusing and immersive storytelling romps, but no other game that I know can actually give you a feeling of a real journey that you take on with your friends.  If you're really looking for that fabled \"RPG-without-a-GM\" holy grail, this may just be it.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Samuel Vriezen", "rating": "6", "comment": "Definitely very, very well-done game in its genre.  My quibble is that I'm finding all the different scenarios rather samey in the end. Yes there is variation, but the playing itself tends to be rather predictable. Though the arc is always quite fulfilling \u2013\u00a0in the middle of any scenario you always go, oh no we're never gonna make it, and then you make it in the nick of time. Nice. but then, next time round, you power up, monsters power up, there are more cool manoeuvres, etc. etc. and it all ends up more or less the same story again: you feel oh no in the middle and hell yeah at the end. And so on, and so on.  So this game has ended up my second choice: I'm never unwilling to play and I have fun when the game it going, but I find other things more fulfilling.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Carighan", "rating": "6", "comment": "I'll be honest... only played 2 games so far, but I don't get the hype. Yeah it's solid, but nothing more than that. Hugely overpriced in a way since it has genuinely *too much* content for a game this simplistic. UItimately it comes down to pretty low-tactics/no-strategy dungeon crawling, room spawns enemies, throw biggest attacks, mop up, next room. Repeat ~400 times and you're done with your campaign. I'd recommend pen&paper instead, even pretty mediocre RPGs do this better since it isn't the whole game there. It isn't bad though. It's just too long and way, way, way too samey and simplistic.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Viking_CTO", "rating": "6", "comment": "First, I think this game is amazing from a perspective of what you get in the box.    My wife bought me this as a gift, fully expecting that she would play as well. We\u2019ve played hundreds of long Terraforming Mars sessions over the last couple of years and were hoping this would bring the same kind of satisfaction (realizing its a completely different type of game but having heard so many good things about it). Alas, it hasn\u2019t so far. She played about half of the first scenario with me before she went to do something else. A couple of days later, I played the first couple of scenarios as solo experiences.   I was an AD&D player in the early 80s, so I thought this might be a nice cross between the combat of AD&D and resource management of some other games.  So far, in my limited experience, I feel heavily constricted when playing the game, and expending cards to move through an empty room also seems weird, though I recognize the game is designed to work that way. A minor quibble was managing damage on the monster sleeves, but I think there are easy work arounds for that.   I haven\u2019t given up on the game, but I think getting my wife to play again will be a non-starter.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Anathoth", "rating": "6", "comment": "I like the overall design of the game. It feels like a \"bit more involved\" (well a lot more involved) Hero's Quest. I like the random elements in the city and on the road, but I think it got to be more tedious than fun. The combat and choose your destiny elements are very fun, but the combat can move at glacier speeds and following the storyline gets confusing. Granted most of the combat issues are user generated, but the game by design or not forces you to take longer than you probably should. If you skip a quest throughout your adventure and try to go back to it, it can be very difficult to remember where you are at and what you are trying to do. The setup takes a good 30 minutes to figure out what characters you are using, where you are at, what cards you want, if you did your city event, if you did your road event, if you need to add effects from either of these, if you are going to upgrade any cards, if you are going to purchase any items, and finally what quest you are going to do. Honestly in the beginning it was part of the reason I loved the game, but it wears you down.   Considering all the \"issues\" it is an incredible board game and if that was it I would give it a 9/10. But alas the final compliant I find with the game is to me the cardinal sin. Board games such as Gloomhaven need a complete world. A world you love going back into. A world you love to explore, and find unique and incredible treasures. A world you can imagine yourself if. Gloomhaven, for me, never got there. I know this is a lot to expect from a board game, but I feel Gloomhaven could have done it with a little bit more effort. Everything was so good, but the characters are bland and boring. I think so of this is derived from creatively attempting to create an entire world that is filled with creatures that are unfamiliar and have no ties to common mythos. I think that the endeavor is to be applauded, but ultimately was unsuccessful. This is what brings if from a 9 to a 6/10. I look at it the box and think I should get that out again, but I don't remember what I was doing, or what our party last achieved, what I WANT to accomplish in the world ect. I think if you could harness the great aspects of this game and give the players an experience where they can alter the world semi-predictably, and that world had a deep, rich history it would be the King, the Game of games. Hopefully the expansion will bring more to this worlds development and get more emotion investment for the players.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The story is okay, the gameplay is simple enough once you learn it, but it suffers from a very real problem for anyone who has children, not a huge space, and a somewhat busy life.  1) It literally has next to 0 organization for all the monsters and cards.  Most people end up setting up their own envelope system in half the box, making this large game take up even more space and take even more hours to organize and set up.  The only thing that's organized by default in this game is the characters and classes.  Even which town and road quests are available is disorganized, increasing the likelihood of something getting lost in the shuffle. 2) It takes up a ridiculously large amount of space, so for most people it's unreasonable to just leave it out until the next game night, and it has enough small, finicky components that even if you do that, a toddler or dog or annoying handsy friend will mess something up and pieces will be gone forever. 3) The story is okay - but it's not anything new or novel or amazing.  It's a very run of the mill fantasy story that's enjoyable, but I don't get the urge to play the next one so much that the annoyance of set up and clean up time is overwhelmed.  It's a good game, but for the effort, I often find myself preferring to play something else.  If the game came with a better organization system, or hell, any organization system, that would have helped a lot.  Finding the tokens for different maps, the monsters, etc...has been improved by my individual organization, but I really shouldn't need to make a system for a board game that costs this much.  It shouldn't be this much work to play a game for an hour, and consequently I don't want to play it that frequently even though my husband and friend do.  It's okay.  I'll play it if I'm in the mood, there are just so many more games out there that aren't inherently flawed in their structure and design that I'd rather play.  Hell, I'd rather plan a round of D&D with the set up time than deal with all the small components.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

I like how you could run separate groups, which would have different experiences in the same world, but might be affected by the choices of each other. I like how you can play, develop and later in the game retire a character. BUT... to me it is just another dungeon crawler. I've seen people get all giddy and excited over the card mechanism. To me it's just a constricted action selection mechanism, which creates an entirely artificial layer of unthematic choice. I've seen people rave about the sheer amount of scenarios. This does not hold any additional appeal for me because I tend to play many different games, instead of playing the same games more often. So a game that requires such a big commitment to complete has to grab me, which Gloomhaven doesn't. Is it a good game? Yeah, I guess. Is it one that I would recommend to others? Probably, depending on their preferences. Is it one that I can get really excited about? Nope, not really.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "trenttsd", "rating": "5.5", "comment": "This is a fantasy-themed cooperative dungeon exploration game in which you use cards to manage the movements and combat of a character on a map and a card-based AI system handles the movements of your adversaries.  The game includes a rather large set of interlinked scenarios that offer a branching storyline.  It also features legacy-style gameplay, which means that you permanently modify the game as you play through it, mostly due to upgrading your character and modifying the map of the world over time.  Gloomhaven is a game that works best early in the campaign, when the clever mechanisms the game uses for moving and fighting enemies is clear, you're learning how to work together within the constraints of the system, and you're enjoying the character growth between scenarios and the growing game world.    The flaw of Gloomhaven is that the variety of the scenarios and the level of actual gameplay variety in the characters themselves, even as you grow them and change character classes, doesn't really match up to the length of the campaign.  After a while, the scenarios begin to feel same-y and the characters, even with the variety they offer, begin to feel same-y, too.  It starts to fall into a path of \"the same old thing\" long before the campaign is over.  I managed to complete the full campaign, but only due to a collective diligence of our group in which we knew if we didn't keep playing it consistently, we would shut the box and never open it again.  The first few scenarios are great, and the character growth and changes between the scenarios are interesting particularly earlier in the campaign, but there just isn't enough variety there to merit all of the stuff.  Try/buy it if: you want an RPG-like experience without a DM, you want a fair number of interesting mechanisms but without a lot of new wrinkles throughout (meaning there's a big learning curve at the start but almost none throughout most of the campaign), you like legacy-style gaming.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The legacy mechanic makes for a lot of mystery and unknown, and yet it's tuned to make scenarios have some difficulty. With good hand management you can extend your actions quite a bit, but even then, if you hit some bad luck, it should challenge you.  If this type of game was more to my liking, I'd probably rate it 9 or 10. As it was, it struck me a light-medium tactical exercise that wasn't terribly difficult. I think our characters may have had better than normal synergy (Brute plus Tinkerer healing and attacks, plus another magic attacker). Even still, if you play your character even a little, there can be brinkmanship in how you play, making you less effective in the combats.  I feel like I've only scratched the surface.

{"username": "tpholt", "rating": "5.5", "comment": "I admit, I must be missing something about this game.  It's the #1 game on BGG and to me it's just \"oh well\".  The trick, to me, is learning how to play card combos, both with your own and with other characters.  Once you figure that out, though, it's just over and over and over the same thing.  Add to that the \"fatigue\" concept (losing a card each \"rest\") makes no sense.  I understand becoming fatigued as a battle rages on, but why should I lose the ability to do something relatively simple but maintain the option to do more strenuous and complex maneuvers?  The Rule book is in dire need of a rewrite by a competent tech writer. It's a mess. (Seriously...long rest vs. short rest?  You couldn't come up with something less confusing...like, say, Pause vs Rest?  See, took me all of 5 seconds to come up with terminology less confusing). The movement and line of sight rules are more convoluted than the tax code.  There is a situation, with the Rules as Written (and VERIFIED by the designer), where you could be, literally, standing next to a hex, with no obstructions between you and it, and yet, by the rules, it is not in your line of sight.  Storage of this behemoth is problematic unless you spend as much on a storage solution as you did on this (very expensive) game.  In the end, this game should have been released as a $30 \"Starter\" set, with, say 6 characters and 20 Scenarios, with \"expansion packs\" available at $20 or so that added 2 or 3 more characters and another 20 scenarios.

Maybe the game is much better with other scenarios, but that scenario was a kickstarter demo scenario so I expected it to show of the game's strengths not its weaknesses.  update:  playing a real scenario instead of the terrible, terrible, terrible tavern scenario raised this from 4/10 to 6/10.  It's neat and interestingly tactical.  I find I get bored of a character playing it over and over, but if I can switch between characters after every few scenarios then it holds its interest.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

What can I say about legacy and coop games. I get the whole narrative idea behind a legacy game, but the thought of mangling my copy makes me feel ill. I hear you can buy stickers, so okay maybe. As for coops, I've almost had my fill of them. A group, with or without a traitor, fight the random card flips and/or dice rolls, of a programmed game design. Either the game is way too easy or nearly impossible. Your destiny might not even be in your hands, like often happens in Pandemic.   I assume Gloomhaven is number one because there has been an explosion of new board gamers coming largely from North America. I imagine, solo mode probably attracts a lot of people who have trouble finding others to play with. In the end, there were a lot of people with money to burn and an itch for the same kind of candy who pushed this Kickstarter forward. Number one in Strategy, really?

{"username": "eviljelloman", "rating": "5", "comment": "[b]TL;DR[/b] A surprisingly dull game, with a too-long setup.  It's fine, but I wouldn't ask for another game.   I usually wait until ten plays before rating a game, but Gloomhaven is a game I expect not to play much again, if at all, so I'm going to write down my thoughts while they are fresh in my mind.  First, a caveat:  I played the game in the random dungeon crawl mode, so I did not experience all of the legacy stuff.  I am rating this based purely on the mechanisms of the individual dungeon crawls, and not on the overall story.  After playing many other story-driven games, I don't think it would be possible for the story to sway my opinion very much.  I adored Pandemic Legacy, because the mechanisms of the game are super fun to me, so the story layered on top of those was awesome.  If the underlying mechanisms don't grab me, though, I don't see myself going back to the game just for a story or to power up my characters.  Good:  Clever two-card system that controls initiative and allows you to do some planning but modify your plans, simple AI decks for the monsters, characters that play wildly differently  Bad:  Massively fiddly setup, not seeing progression of a character within a single game, losing cards as a timer mechanism.  I think the thing that bugs me most about Gloomhaven is how it reverses the power curve of most games.  From a simple deck builder like Dominion to a complex beast like Too Many Bones, throughout the game you get more powerful.  You add cards to your deck or dice to your pool, and get to do more and more cool stuff.  In Gloomhaven, you keep removing cards from your hand, and can do less and less.  It might be thematic, representing exhaustion as you delve deeper into a dungeon, but it's just not very fun to me.  I liked stuff about the game, and imagine the legacy elements and long-term power-up of your characters would certainly improve it, but the core mechanisms are just not engaging enough to make me choose to invest that much time and effort.  It's a game that's completely [i]fine[/i], but I'm not spending that much money, and using that much shelf space, for a game that's just fine.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}
{"username": "Alan Stern", "rating": "5", "comment": "Not for me.  The key choices are which cards of your dwindling hand to play when and then which top/bottom pairing.  It didn't strike me.  Yes it's an interesting take on the dungeon crawl archetype and yes it has choices, but they never truly struck me as being tactical.  \"I chose this pair because I was planning to do something... and my party member has blown up my plans.  So my play was for nothing.  Ugh.\"  I really didn't like the idea of making choices not only in the absence of enemy information (which I readily accept), but also in the absence of party members' information/plans.  It just didn't work for me.  EDIT (6/29/18):  After talking with friends, it sounds like my gripe is more with the play style of the players in my game than with the game itself.  Players can, and should, coordinate their efforts.  That being said, my experience left a bad taste in my mouth (metaphorically) and the core mechanic (play 2 cards, when it's your turn you choose which top and which bottom) doesn't ring true for me.  It's less of a puzzle and more of a... blind plan.  But then maybe that's the game?  Maybe you make your plans knowing that they are constructed with completely imperfect information?  Maybe what annoys me is that you lock in your options (select your 2 cards) THEN get enough information to determine if your choice was good/valid and use one of the two pairings (top/bottom) now available to you.  There's no opportunity for response - it's all just blind planning (and I can't construe that as a strategy).  Hmmm.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Greywolf2001ca", "rating": "5", "comment": "Lots of really nice features in the game like variety, replayability, depth, good stories, unique characters, etc.  There is one big drawback though, lots of annoying procedures, some of which should have not survived proper play-testing. All that shuffling and reshuffling is killing the game. You waste so much time doing that that your scenario takes from 5 to 15 minutes longer (depending on the size of the scenario). Replacing the eight monster cards with a table you roll onto would have maybe removed the surprise of what is behind he next card, but it would have removed lots of useless procedures.  I have nothing against heavy games but as long as they use mechanics and not procedures. Because when to do procedures, you are not playing, as for mechanics, you do things because of an action you did. For example, Agricola is a heavy medium game that has mechanics and just two small procedures each turn (turning turn card and adding things to the board) which does not bog game play much. In Gloomhaven, you shuffle your deck, you shuffle the monster's deck, the other players shuffle their decks, you must draw a monster card for each monster type, you must draw and attack card for each monster miniature, you must draw a card for each attack card of your character, the other players do the same, etc.  This card system belongs to another age, the 1980s.  I am certain that we can figure out a much more efficient way to play Gloomhaven that would reduce the time scenarios take to finish by a good 20%. Not to mention diminishing the box's content and weight (thus reducing its cost so it will sell more).  Our group of game designers and our coaches hates procedures. There are too many small rules too.  Unless streamlined, like Arkham Horror this game would be best as a video game than a board game right now.  Without the heavy procedures and small rules, this game is a 10/10.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

First, the physical setup is a huge pain, finding the right monsters and tokens and tiles, setting up the monster cards, the various draw decks, dealing with the town inventory and events, ... it takes too long.  That would be fine, but the game just isn't that interesting.  Enter small dungeon, kill a bunch of boring mobs, repeat.  The card play is interesting, I guess, as there's a few combos, but it doesn't compare to Mage Knight.  Your character does a few interesting things, and every so often you get a neat combo, but it's usually just Attack (top) and Move (bottom).  The game becomes less interesting as your options dwindle, and it's just stupid when you have 2 cards in hand: do a thing, rest, lose.  Just do that for 2-3 hours.  For 1 session.  Of 70-95.

Don't get me wrong, there is so much stuff in there, unbelievable. After a few plays I can say that this looks pretty promising.  Come back for more feedback after a short commercial break.  14 games into the realm of Gloomhaven and I'm not seeing anything that will stop us from playing it.  ---  After 30 games I sold it. Why? Because it got stale. How? Well... There is nothing the game could offer me that was new. Honestly the scenarios don't have that much replay value. Yes you can do it again to try a different strategy for it but there won't be something new. The characters are the same. It is pretty samey. The story is close to non-existant. If you are honest to yourself Gloomhaven promises way more that it can deliver. Immersive world and story and characters and gameplay...  No. The world comes down to a few texts on small event cards that are randomly drawn from a deck and therefor have no thematic connection to your current state of play. That is also true for the praised story. The story consists of a text at the beginning and one at the end of a scenario, which againb don't really have a connection to your state of play. You can advance in almost any order and through some decisions I made in my playthrough I had some pretty strong disconnects where the story didn't make sense anymore.  Besides that it is pretty much generic. Yeah Isaac Childres designed a new world without the generic races and classes...but....let's be honest, somehow it still feels pretty generic. With a few exceptions.  I don't really get a connection to my char. I like the slow progress, that is somehow new to boardgames, where you normally are getting a level up faster or a level up feels stronger. But it is also somehow frustrating...not frustrating...more... boring.  Maybe it is the euro nature of this that doesn't fit the theme. A euro-dungeon crawl sounds like some pretty innovative thing but at a certain point it wasn't fun anymore. There is no time to do as you like. No, you have to be efficient to achieve something. A Conan is much better in keeping the players involved and at the edge of their seats. Gloomhaven feels way to slow and way to unspectacular.  I appreciate the design of low(er) luck through the hit-deck and all the things that it does but somehow...  Don't get me wrong. I loved the game for the first 15 plays liked it for the next 10...and I still think that it is a good design but for me there are too many things that made it stumble and fall.

{"username": "jmmcreynolds", "rating": "5", "comment": "I really want to like this game, but it just isn't for me. I've played 5 scenarios now and admit that there are a lot of cool things that they've done to make an immersive game. However, I've noticed that as we've progressed I've hoped things would get better and go faster because we were more familiar with how everything worked and played. That's not the case. The last game we played I zoned out a number of times once I played my turn and while others played and resolved their turns and the monsters. There's too much administrative stuff that goes on in between turns and I just lose interest...ok, which monster goes first? Oh, wait, the elites go first. Oh, there's a lower numbered one here. What was their attack again? ...and on and on. We had 4 different classes and well over 10 monsters on the board multiple times in our last play and it was a pain to try to remember whose turn it was and who goes next... In other words, there's too much fiddly stuff and not enough game for me. Some people may like that though, so give it a try and decide for yourself.  I found a couple other things to be annoying. First is that this game can be frustrating (punishing?), and not in a good way. For the last two scenarios we played we had an event at the beginning that penalized us by having to discard two cards before we started. That was pretty punishing. One event, on top of that, also made us lose a checkmark, but gain one reputation. I thought that was pretty brutal as well. Granted, gaining a reputation \"might\" have been a nice trade for losing a checkmark, but as slow as checkmarks seem to be earned it was a bit of a blow (I only have 3 so far). The last game, the battle goal that I chose couldn't even be accomplished! (there was no treasure that I could have picked up). There are also times where you choose your cards and hope to be able to do something, but due to turn order and other actions that are taken, your cards end up being more or less worthless and that \"big\" turn you were hoping to have is more or less wasted. Granted, this doesn't happen all the time, but it seemed to happen more in the last game we played and it's really frustrating, and not in a good way. I'm not saying the game is too difficult, we've actually won all 5 scenarios, and the last two have been really close. We had pretty much given up on the last one, but managed to pull off a win. You'd think that would leave most people with something cool to talk about, getting close to losing but eking out a win. Some might think I'm complaining too much and stuff like this is done to make the game more \"challenging\". However, when that \"thrill of victory\" is overshadowed by all the other fiddly stuff and frustration, due to events, lack of rewards, etc., it's not a recipe for a successful game or helping me to want to play it again. The second point is that progression of my character is going way to slow. Granted, maybe over the long haul it works out better, but 5 plays in and I have 2 extra health and one new card I can play with. I don't feel any more powerful than I did when I started and I don't want to play through 5(?) more mind numbing games to modestly upgrade my character. Yes, we did get some cool items in the beginning, and there are probably more to come, but when the monsters get bigger and badder and I'm not so big and bad anymore it's not as fun. I want to rage and destroy things! Usually it feels like I'm just poking and annoying things. Maybe I'm approaching this game wrong (like I did with SeaFalll...??? ...no, my approach to SeaFall wouldn't have made any difference ;)), but I spend an entire game trying to best use my abilities and do some pretty cool stuff and when it's all said and done I find myself thinking, \"That's it? That's all I got for all these wounds, all that blood lost, and all that effort?\" Maybe it eventually gets to a point, at higher character levels, where the reward seems more appropriate, but I doubt I'll have the patience to see if that's the case.  Yes, it's fun to try to puzzle your way through a scenario with what you and your party have. I think they did a pretty great job putting everything together to make it a challenge, one you really have to think through and are limited on time. You can't necessarily just go exploring everywhere with each scenario an expect to survive (you could run out of cards and become exhausted). There's a pretty great game in there if you have the patience for all the other stuff you have to wade through in order to find that game. During the last game I played I found myself thinking that there's just too much fiddly stuff going on and it would be better off as a video game. Gloomhaven, all your hype just wasn't for me and I'm moving on. So glad I didn't back this one.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Ultimately, we found the play to become repetitive (changing monsters and classes, while technically altering tactics, doesn't effect how the game *feels*), also without investment in a storage solution the game easily takes 15-20 min to set up, and the same to take down.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "newkillerstar27", "rating": "5", "comment": "Really wanted to like Gloomhaven more than I did, especially since I kickstarted it. Much like the designer's other game, however, Forge War, this felt like more work than fun. The card play is very neat, and I like how the game manages to simulate a Disgaea-like game without dice. Furthermore, I feel like the story has some real potential, and the characters all feel very unique.  That being said, I'm not sure why I would ever choose to play this over something like Fire Emblem. I played through 4 scenarios, and with setup and take-down time, I was clocking in at about 2 hours a scenario, which is frankly too much. Despite all of Gloomhaven's little innovations, it still feels bloated and very fiddly. Setup is a real chore, especially since the game lacks much of an insert at all, and you better hope you have a large table for everything.   My philosophy with board games lately is, why play a slower-paced, inferior version of something you could just play a very similar experience to in video game format? That is my chief reason for not liking Gloomhaven as much as I probably should. For as much as I love the complex yet simplified combat and the character development, the game just doesn't return the investment of time I put into it. Also, I feel like the legacy aspect is almost non-existent. You sticker the board and occasionally cards, but not in any meaningful way.  I looked through some of the higher level stuff, and it does look like grinding your characters eventually pays off. At the same time, it's really difficult and fiddly to keep track of all the status effects. Call me lazy, but I don't think games need to be this convoluted anymore. I'll also mention that while the rule book gets the concepts across, it reminded me of the Xia rule book, where it was more like a reference guide than an adequate way to learn the game.  Oh well...my quest continues for the game that scratches both my Fire Emblem and dungeon crawl itches in board game form. Zombicide is the closest thing so far, but its scope is pretty limited. I can see groups enjoying Gloomhaven over multiple, multiple plays, but I'll take it one step further; Why play this when you can just play a role-playing game? That's basically what this is trying to be. Unfortunately, the game feels more like work than fun, to me.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Interesting to open envelopes and all when there are new findings.  However, I'm not sure the continual combat stuff would keep me coming back for ninety odd episodes, but I would play again a few times.  Also, 90-120 minutes to fight out three or four rooms feels like a lot, especially given the setup time.  The box certainly is impressively enormous with a lot of content, so you don't get cheated there.  Nice spiral bound encounter booklet.

{"username": "Darador", "rating": "5", "comment": "I tried Gloomhaven out only once at SPIEL Essen 2017 and only skimmed the rules, so you may want to take this comment with more than one grain of salt. My rating could well change considerably with further games, but a 5 is my best estimate for now. However, I feel confident in already saying that I think this game is overhyped and overrated. Apparently, the publisher contributed to that by prompting people \"Don't forget to rate this a 10 when you pre-order!\". Which I view as at least dubious behavior (on the publisher's part). I have deducted one point from the rating I would otherwise have given to protest against it and offset the unfairly high rating a tiny bit. - As for how the game plays, I dislike the way the game tries to solve a possible alpha gamer problem by having vague and circumventable rules which information you are allowed to discuss during the game and by having secret battle goal cards. I don't think there should be any restrictions on which information players are allowed to divulge in a game like this. I searched the rulebook for this issue, thumbs up that the rules at least include a remark about playing without information/communication restrictions as a variant and how to compensate difficulty level if one does (on p. 16). - The potentially problematic player elimination mechanism that the game has when a character gets \"exhausted\" gets worse if played without open information so that the dropped out players have a harder time to still somewhat participate in the game. How bad this is depends a lot on how frequently exhaustion happens, not sure about that. - I don't dislike legacy aspects in general, but I think the game should be completely resettable - particularly when it is as expensive as Gloomhaven. I hate it when the rules require you to permanently modify your game. Gloomhaven includes numerous irremovable stickers. At least a third party company already offers a set of removable stickers to replace them. I would expect the original publisher to include such stickers in the game or at least sell them as an optional add-on themselves.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Actually upleveling by XP doesn\u2019t work for me (when your character dies you start again with 0 XP, so accumulating 45+ XP for upleveling means you have to be very lucky).

{"username": "Thunkd", "rating": "5", "comment": "Gloomhaven is a dungeon crawl. If you like that kind of thing, you'll probably really like it. But there are few games that bore me more than dungeon crawls.  The innovative twist to Gloomhaven is that you have a hand of cards and on a round you select two of them. One of your cards is the \"lead\" card for its initiative number. All the players and monsters resolve their turns in initiative order. On your turn you choose one card for its attack ability and the other for it's move ability. If the things you wanted to do aren't applicable anymore you can always use the card for its default attack ability of a 2 point attack or the default move ability of 2 move.  Cards are discarded after they're used, although more powerful cards get \"lost\". When you are running low on cards you have to decide whether to rest or not. Resting allows you to pick up your discarded cards but forces you to \"lose\" a card from those you picked up. Lost cards don't normally come back to you during the game, so they're a clock on how quickly you have to defeat the baddies.  Other than that it's a pretty standard dungeon crawl. There's an attack modifier deck for each player and all the bad guys which can augment or diminish the attack, rarely causing you to do double damage or miss completely. The other thing that makes Gloomhaven stand out is that it's built for campaigns and has a leveling up system. And personal goals. The more you do that type of stuff the more you get to upgrade your personal hand with better cards and tune your attack modifier deck.  I only played a non-campaign game, so the campaign bits weren't terribly relevant. But while I can see how they'd add something interesting for other players, they're not going to change my opinion of the game any. I've never enjoyed MMORPG or dungeon crawls where you're going out, fighting baddies, getting treasure and then upgrading so that you get better at doing the exact same thing over and over. Bumping me up levels and improving my stats and making me more powerful and throwing harder bad guys at me doesn't do anything to convince me that I'm doing anything different. I always feel like I'm stuck in a time loop being forced to repeat the same boring experiences over and over in these types of games. There's no sense of achievement or accomplishment for me.  The cardplay was something that I thought might be interesting in this game, but it didn't really stand out to me. It never seemed that difficult to choose which cards to play. I never had to struggle with painful choices. Sometimes the outcomes weren't great (mostly when the baddies flipped up their round modifier cards and unexpected things happened), but it was always fairly straightforward what needed to be done and what I needed to keep for later.  As I just mentioned, every round the bag guys flip a card which determines their initiative and changes their attack/move/special abilities for the round. Between that and the attack modifier decks, there was often a lot of unexpected changes from the time you selected your cards and when combat resolved. Which meant you just picked the best cards, hoped for the best and made do with how things turned out.  Overall, this isn't a game I'd particularly want to play. If someone really wanted to, I would, but I'd never request it. And honestly, there's nothing in this game that makes it stand out for me more than something like Castle Ravenloft. Yeah, I know there are differences, but those differences aren't important to me. They deliver the same experience for me. As for a campaign, I'd quickly tire of having to play this game more than once every couple of months. The idea of being tied into a weekly multi-year campaign is something that I'd just flat out refuse.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

I have great respect for the amount of design and development that went into Gloomhaven, but it seemed old from the moment i laid out the first scenario.  Two key observations:   -the enemy cards and sleeves with 8 variable levels for each monster type are a fantastic innovation.   -on the other hand, i truly disliked the action card innovation - for example, the game really needs an \"out of combat\" phase which allows post-combat movement, looting and resting without (random) LOSS of spell/action cards.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Lots of content in that 10 kg box, but it does a bad job of selling itself to you on your first game - scenarios are hard, and while you're eager to see what comes next in the campaign, having to redo a failed scenario is boring. The game holds out on its good stuff, and too much is left to chance when you are low-level. For a game that wanted to be a dungeon crawl without dice, it failed at crafting an experience that was in the players's hands, and it's clumsy at handling it's incentives and difficulty curve, I feel like I have to revisit it because my roommate shelled out a lot of money for it, but I wouldn't care if I never played it again.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Will play to completion because we\u2019ve invested so much time but at that point will be left well alone. Very mathsy, humourless.

{"username": "pingus", "rating": "5", "comment": "I finally played it! And it has it moments. The core mechanic of choosing two cards is nice and the timer of the cards on your hand is fine, but seriously: number 1? I expected so much more.  My main problem is that within one game I as a character don't get stronger but weaker and the game takes sooo much time and maintance and it's usually just going throught the motions. I really think that computer games like: Darkest Dungeon, Cardhunter and Desktop Dungeon are much nicer to play. This box is so full of stuff and it's nice, but the setup is such a pain for so little reward. After playing one character I would immediately want to switch for the next game so developing them between games is not that enganging.  The best game to compare it to that works for me (and GH doesn't) is Spirit Island. There I am actually progressing throught the game, getting better, there is a sense of going for late/early game strats. It's also more interesting, because it's not another hit monsters as hard as you can as quickly as you can. There is more room for creative cooperation.   Gloomhaven is fine for its genre, but it's not gamechanging.

{"username": "Smith606", "rating": "5", "comment": "Played and finished a 4P campaign over the course of a few months. I initially had a lot of fun playing, and it served as a great RPG-Lite. I do still like the initiative & deck mechanics, but...  Everything became very samey. Outside of the excitement of cracking open a new character, the game seemed to slog on. Specifically, there was a lot of disappointment when we would get a new character, play some games with them and quickly realise they either weren't fun to play, or were a detriment to the team (or both). Some characters, such as Music Note and Lightning Bolts were very, very OP and pretty much carried the rest of the characters through the campaign.   The storylines were not that engaging (not that we expected much from a board game) and we were glad to just finally reach the last level and end it. We cheated a little to find the hidden secret stuff and were very disappointed at the outcome.   I have a middling review for this because the honeymoon period with this game was so much fun. Exploring the mechanic, getting it wrong, mastering it, moving to a new character to find a new rhythm - they were the glory days. The scale of difficulty did not actually scale the level of enjoyment we had, however, and as the game progressed we got tired of it and just wanted it to end so we could put it away for good.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Sarchiapon", "rating": "5", "comment": "This must be one of the most overrated games in board games history, if not the most. There would a lot of things to argue about it, but let it suffice to say that we started the campaign by getting irrimediably stucked in one of the first missions (and we had to play it about four times before we had grind enough to get on top of it), while the last two-three before we ceased play were a complete breeze to the point of being absolutely boring. I suspect that this jarring lack of balance for a game that is supposed to have \"great production value\" is partly due to the characters change system. You are supposed to fulfill your personal quest quite early and change you experienced character with another one, which starts the game at a lower level, without items, and with way less cards at your disposal. The idea, at this point, is that having to grind for your new character kinda turns the game more challenging again, expecially if other players change their characters about the same time (which happened). However i had the \"luck\" to got a personal quest that was nigh to impossible to complete early if not by following a very specific path of scenarios, something that was not feasible in the short run because my teammates would occasionally need to play other scenarios to fulfill their quests too. The result was that, after about 15 missions, the two strongest characters in the team (mine and another) were more or less able to win every scenario by themselves, even tho the other two characters were underleveled. This made for a quite funny paradox: i could not change my character because i had bad luck with my personal quest, but in the process of being stucked to it, that character turned out so strong (i had the scoundrel), that the balance of the game went completely haywire. I don't think i can find a better example of lose-lose situation than that.  Of course, i could live with a game (and expecially a dungeon crawler) being mostly unbalanced if i had other reasons to enjoy it. But i'm afraid i found very little of them. My teammates were almost completely uninterested in the story or the setting, and after a dozen of \"kill them bandits\" style missions, i can't be helped but think they had a point. The hand management part of the game was sometimes interesting enough, but i mostly ended up going through the same motion everytime: play all the cards that does not remove themselves from the deck after being played, and use the others only during the final part of the scenario (sometimes for no more reason than grab their xp bonus), once you are sure you are not going to lose for deck exhaustion. I never found (at least from the viewpoint of the cards of my character) a good reason to deviate from this plan. Given that it's increasingly more difficult for a character to be killed by damage the more levels, items and better cards it has, the game naturally encourages you to keep your hand close, and the cards that are supposed to be more powerful if you forfeit them in the process of playing them are not really worth the risk.   Adding to that, the game is quite a rules nightmare: i understand the need to have some kind of AI for the actions of the monsters, as a way to avoid the necessity of a game master, however the relative rules are ambiguous and confusing, and for the sake of not simply add a line to advice players to move enemies in a way that made sense for them (that would have been way easier, and no seasoned player would have had a problem in managing monsters this way), it's easy to misinterpret said rules and give players an unduly advantage (we had monsters throwing themselves to death into traps or lava because we could not find the rules that told us they would have behaved otherwise). Cards, too, are far from being clear on numerous points, and we often had to stop to google for answers (and the fact that we almost always find the answers we needed suggest that it was not a case of us being too picky about rules). All in all, the general experience of this game was irritating and boring...and the fact that the designers decided to prevent players from sharing goods, and to give them hidden objectives possibly in contrast with each other and sometimes even with the completion of the mission, did not help either, because it was often the reason of discussions at the table (which, depending by the case or the playing group, it may be amusing or not). Why, in a game that is meant to be a full cooperative, the designers decided to force players to kinda think for themselves in more than few occasions, is completely beyond me.  All in all again, Gloomhaven was a dull experience at best, and a fiddly and obnoxious one at worst. I can't imagine what exactly went wrong with this game during development or why its designers thought they would be walking in the right way in making it as it is. I can only say that i'm not interested in playing it anymore.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "M St", "rating": "5", "comment": "The nth Dungeon game, but with more bits.  Moves quickly enough after a few turns, but often the writing is tiny and really hard to read, as are many of the symbols and pictures in the rules.  The key card mechanism is classic self-convolution - decisions and tradeoffs for their own sake, not because they seem to make sense as choices in a real situation.  After three rooms, you've worked out the character type, from then on it's just slog though reasonably pleasurable with friends.  Would be a favourite if I were looking for a game that takes as long as possible to play, but though I would not mind coming back to it  (if I don't have to do the setup sorting), I don't see what the hullabaloo is about.  I dislike the undeclared legacy nature of the game, though apparently there are components that mitigate it. It does feel like Baldur's Gate redone as a boardgame, which is technically a compliment but really just means that the design is quite literalist as compared to someone who thinks about making a good boardgame.

I abhor the idea of Legacy games, but I knew from the beginning that Gloomhaven can be played with removable stickers which I also bought, so the Legacy issue was solved.  Last week I read the rules, they aren\u2019t very hard to understand but the rulebook makes them a lot harder to learn. It begins by explaining the cards and how to set up the scenarios but only on page 16 it begins to really explain how to play the game. That\u00b4s illogical and it makes them a lot harder to learn because it throws you all the terms/rules without any context of how to use them. It should explain first the turn structure and then continue with the rest. Once you understand them, they aren\u2019t hard to explain. You can do it under 30 minutes because there are many MANY rules, but they make sense so it is easy to teach. Playtime is very variable because it depends on the scenario, still, I feel gameplay goes very slow, downtime is high (a cardinal sin for me).  Best 3 players.  I really like the theme and the name is awesome.  Gloomhaven\u00b4s components are, in general, very good. The box comes filled to the brim with content and it is a very big box (the biggest in my collection). It has so much cardboard, that closing the lid after punching it is very hard. For the price you pay, the game deliver a lot of content. The player\u00b4s miniatures are gorgeous. The game come with standees for the monsters and they are too tight, that\u2019s very bad because you have to constantly put them on and take them off, damaging the monster tiles in the process.  The art of the game is ok. The terrain tiles are a little too generic, but they are ok. I expected the art to be a bit better but I don't mind.   The rulebook doesn\u2019t have a comprehensive list of components which I found appalling. Instead of saying how many monsters of each type, it lumps them together and says \u201c240 monster standees\u201d so counting them is a very time consuming chore and if you lose one, finding the missing one will be very time consuming.  Punching the game is a nightmare and it takes a lot of time to do so. Sleeving the cards is also a boring task as it has around 1500 cards.   Gameplay is very interesting at first, but then it becomes very repetitive. Each player and monster will act on a given turn in order of initiative. Monsters are directed by an artificial intelligence. Players will play 2 cards from their hand. Choosing which card to play isn\u2019t obvious, but it isn\u2019t also a hard decision. The amount of cards you have at hand is also your life (of sorts) and you can never recuperate it at 100%, so it works as a (very slow) timer. When you level up you get access to more powerful cards.  I really like the idea behind the game, but it doesn\u2019t have anything that hasn\u2019t been done before (to an extent). The campaign goal is to achieve the scenario\u00b4s succeed condition so you get experience and loot. I really like the idea of leveling up (I love Pathfinder) but here is too slow (because the game lack excitement for me). Also the idea of retiring a character doesn\u2019t appeal to me as I want to take him to the maximum possible level, but I understand the concept in the game and when you retire, new characters become avalible (very neat). I thought the first scenario was going to be much faster than it was and it only has 3 tiles!  When you finish an scenario, other scenarios become avalible, this progression is very cool, but nothing new.  Much like Kingdom Death monster, after the scenario you can go home to regroup, level up, retire, and buy and sell new equipment and many other things. I do love that, even though Gloomhaven is a cooperative game, you gold and your stuff is yours . Players cannot share gold between themselves and that\u2019s new for me in this format (although it doesn't make thematic sense it allows for egotistical play) . As in KDM, I like this phase much more than the game itself and that\u2019s very telling for me. I think I shouldn't be playing Gloomhaven.  When I was playing Gloomhaven, a couple of times I thought I could be playing Myth instead (a superior game in my book). I feel the same way when I play both games, but I prefer Myth at this point in time. Myth also has a campaign mode, side quests, leveling up so they are very similar in my mind but Myth isn't a Legacy game. I know Gloomhaven develops a unique game situation with the (semi) permanent stickers to signal global changes and player level/experience, but I'm pretty sure this feeling could be simulated without permanently modifying the game. Gloomhaven lose some points for being a Legacy game, for me, the waste is too much.  Gloomhaven has a lot of replayability, it has many different scenarios.  Setup time and tear down time are very high.  If I were to continue with the campaign, Gloomhaven would become a lifestyle game. It has many scenarios and I wouldn\u2019t be able to complete even half of them in a year nor I would want to do that as I prefer to play many other games.  The game has a high luck factor, but as it is a cooperative game I don\u2019t mind it as much. Unlike most games in the genre, here you won\u2019t roll any dice, instead you have cards to determine the outcome of a battle. At first I enjoyed this mechanism as you can influence the outcome (with advantage or leveling up, or getting perks) but as you battle a lot in each scenario, at the end I was bored by it, it is way too repetitive. I cannot believe I\u2019m going to say this, but I think I miss the dice.   Bottom line, As Gloomhaven is currently number 1 here at BGG, I was expecting something great but I was sorely disappointed. I found a game that feels exactly like other dungeon crawler games I have played before (Myth, KDM) and I didn\u2019t found anything special about it. I understand this game is not for me. I\u2019m a bit sad about the time I spent learning it, sleeving it, punching it and organizing it. I will play it again because I made a commitment with my game group, but at this point, I would prefer to sell it. This is the final nail in the \u201cfantasy dungeon crawler\u201d style of game for me. I still (somewhat) like Descent (one vs many) and I love MoM: Second Edition (perhaps due to the theme?, I need to think about this) but I won\u2019t ever buy or pursue a play of this kind of game. It feels like too much work for too little reward, Gloomhaven is very repetitive and very slow. I recognize Gloomhaven can be a tremendous game for other people but it isn't for me. I was expecting too much from it, I will learn my lesson this time. I prefer Kingdom Death Monster over it and I don't really like KDM.

{"username": "Dark_Knight", "rating": "4.4", "comment": "I'll be honest-I bought the game to escape the insanity coming out of the White House circa 2017. I bought the game on the first wave of \"The New\", and wanted a solo game to just really deeply sink my teeth into-for MONTHS.  I got the game, opened it with tons of anticipation, and, as I am big on surprises-opened none, and looked at no spoilers. I worked my way thru Scenario #1 playing 3 Characters solo at Normal Level.  Mmmm-okay....'Kill all the Monsters'  Went back to Gloomhaven with each character having $7 or $8 each-not enough for anything good for Scenario #2-so I decided they could 'loan' $$ and bought 2 $10 helmets (I THINK) -    During this time I was going back and forth to the game board, the rule book and the forums to try and figure stuff out and got pretty seriously barked at by a fellow gamer who felt that my characters 'loaning' the $2 or $3 to 2 others so that at least 2 (rather than 0) could make SOME microscopic improvement for Scenario #2-he basically called me a cheater...he's probably right....then to Scenario #69 - which - facing all those monsters? I just did a massive free-for all...well I could get into it (and will but want to avoid even spoilers here)...  but still-almost 'kill all the monsters'  got the goal-back to Gloomhaven for Scenario #2-and about mid-way thru Scenario #2. The massive kludge of which monster is on Initiative (UGH! Open a door and suddenly all the monsters with lower Initiative are up to bat) - watching your guys sometimes get smacked for turns and no real way to help barring using some of your real aces-in-the-hole  and about half-way thru, I realized that this incredible 9.02 #1 rated game is...'kill all the monsters'  Now-I'll just imagine that all the secrets and tricks and turns and NPCs and la la la are \"all that\", and I'll even just imagine that this game really does rock with 2+ players-but for me?  Poop.  Packed it and put it up for sale.  Super duper sad to see this #1/9.02 game that is hard-to-get (OOS) and this one of the very first sales for it fetching a mere $100 (minus the BGG 3% means this was about a $53 learning lesson for me).", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

I went from loving this game to hating it.  I used to have it rated as a 9 when I first got it.  The mechanics of it are very clever, interesting, and fun.  The rules seem complex at first, but are actually really fluid and intuitive after a few plays.    However, my problem is that once the veneer of the \"new\" wears off, you realize the game is really a \"Johnny-One-Note.\"  It only sings one song.    After a while, every scenario feels the same and the world building isn't substantial enough to hold my interest.  Like I said, the mechanics are very cool, but that's not enough for me.  If you enjoy puzzles more than a dynamic and thematic experience, you will probably like this game.  But, if you want something with more verve and dynamism, I'd say look elsewhere.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Smottz", "rating": "4", "comment": "Having experienced Gloomhaven, I see very diminishing returns over something like Street Masters (which is a breeze to set up). Gloomhaven is like wandering into a game designer's version of \"A Beautiful Mind\"\u2014astounding to see all of the meticulously interconnected threads, but also a bit alarming.  I admire the effort, but am partial to temperate designs that capture large experiences without resorting to unnecessary volume and complexity. There are many consolidation opportunities that were not taken in this game, so we get lots of different boards, tokens, cards, sheets, stickers, checkboxes, map tiles, standees (ugh, standees), and rules, including the dissatisfying central mechanism: choosing from a dwindling set of actions split between two cards.  In summary, the game is like that moment when someone shows you their massive sports memorabilia collection, and you tip the hat to the passion which drove the pursuit, but you're kind of glad when the visit is over and you can return to playing sports.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "ecspiegel", "rating": "4", "comment": "Gloomhaven was great at first. The character progression was fun, the scenarios were challenging, the card play was interesting. Quickly things went downhill.   The randomness of the card draws for damage continually felt punishing. The loss of a great turn due to a null damage draw was demoralizing because of how difficult it was to manage the hand of player cards (I began missing dice rolling immediately). The scenarios began way too hard and stayed way too hard to be fun for us. The setup and takedown were way too cumbersome (even with the Broken Token insert). The bookkeeping was tedious and fiddly.   The Monster AI rules were so difficult to keep straight I never felt confident we were playing the game correctly. Any game where fan-made flow charts are needed to get a grasp of the Monster AI rules is a huge negative. This is the major design flaw of the game in my opinion. If you browse the forums you'll constantly see many questions and contradictory answers regarding this aspect.  I was mostly excited to experience the progression of my character. Instead I experienced having to replay the same (90 minute plus long) scenarios over and over again to make any progress with the story arc.

{"username": "Amuny", "rating": "4", "comment": "This game could be fun, but the setup and overall flow of the game is rather slow.  I didn't feel as engaged as I usually end up being in similar games. There is a LOT of little things to manage (monster decks for their AI, monster figures, monsters attack modifier deck, monster sheets with health tokens and conditions tokens, elemental effects, your own decks , treasure managements, the way initiative work when you open a door...)  I really feel like the general flow is just taking too much from the necessity to setup all these things. Finding cardboards monsters is also a pain if you don't have a very neat storage solution.  The whole campaign part, with characters having their quests and goals, and the city evolving through your deeds, that, is top notch. The \"storytelling\" feels bad and the writing is just bad. I kind of want to play more of it, but since the battle/scenario feels a bit tedious and somewhat boring, I'm still unsure how much I want to invest in this game.   Also, Solo play is nowhere as fun as I expected it to be. May be Mage Knight rose my expectations, but solo play in gloomhaven is even more slow and you just get to manage everything alone; and that's a whole lot of things to manage.  It has a great potential, but again, monster management is too heavy. Story is bland, and system is just overloaded.  Could be a solid game, but I have to realize that after slightly over 30hours of gameplay, I'm still not confident I want to continue. ", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The strategy aspect is weak. Positional, spatial, area control mechanics are pretty basic and boring/too easy. The role playing aspect is shallow and lacking in options for the player. Most choices are binary and obvious, ie \"eat the green berries or the red berries\" snoor. The card management is dumb, basic, no challenge and no flavor. The horror aspect is weak, to easy and not scary. The attempt at fusing theses aspects into one game is in my opinion unsuccessfull. Role playing is too dumb for role players, strategy is too dumb for war gamers, card management is too dumb for card gamers and the horror aspect is just weak and not scary. I think fusing all this together would probably never work well. If I want cards or horror I'd rather play AH, for role playing I'd rather play d&d or any number of great rpgs and for strategy, Christ's sake, Risk is even better than GH. What it does have in its favor (what I suspect makes it popular) is that unboxing fetish thing. Like those thousands of videos on YouTube of people opening and building lego sets. Seems like people get off on unpackaging toys and games lately and if that's your thing than GH is def your game. With all that said, when my friends wanna play this game I go ahead and play it.

You know you will die horribly in some time and are not even allowed to have fun until its time.   I guess people got greek mythology wrong. Sisyphos had to play Gloomhaven not roll a rock uphill.  95 scenarios and mostly the same bland (gameplay and design) rooms you go in kill and go out.  Its a technical problem and you talk about it like looking for a math solution. No surprises. Every monster is waiting in order.   Simple enemy AI. There are just much better AIs out there.  The lack of a good plot and theme is nicely hidden at the beginning by the legacy aspect of adding new content but the longer it goes on the more obvious is the lack of immersion. Or to be more precise. Outside the missions you get a feel of the world but while in a dungeon the theme is not present. Its just generic cookie cutter smashing foes.  My suspicion: the same game without any indiehype & ks would have been depicted  a lot more regarding its faults but sadly most of boardgames professional review industry is working with a big fat bias.  I wasnt biased against the game at the beginning and even participated in the forum while the ks was active.

{"username": "Noribushi", "rating": "4", "comment": "I'm comfortable with complex games, but I feel that every mechanic should serve a useful purpose. Gloomhaven is filled with extraneous mechanics that add complexity, but often with little strategic or entertainment value. For example, the modifier decks add a ton of cards that could have been replaced by a single die; the trade-off is that the modifier decks can be altered permanently or temporarily, theoretically adding strategic value, but the difference (at least so far, several weeks into the campaign), is comparatively minute compared to the pain in the ass of having a deck for every player AND the monsters too. Have one new player accidentally shuffle the cards together (an easy mistake, considering how some of the decks look almost identical), and enjoy taking another 30 minutes sorting them out.  Nearly every aspect of the game's design feels inelegant, by which I mean there are countless pieces that feel redundant or unnecessary. The board pieces in particular include many map sections that are virtually indistinguishable from each other (some almost exactly the same shape and art), yet must be arranged together in a specific way, tediously making setup take longer than need be.  The sheer cost of this game and the investment of time it takes to set up, organize, and put away the pieces (they sell an additional ludicrously priced accessory just for this purpose) makes it, in my opinion, a terrible investment. For that value, you could buy several excellent games.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

It's okay, but anyone getting into this because of its high ranking should do a lot more research before plunking down $100+ for this game.  Gloomhaven essentially distills Mage Knight's combat into its own europuzzly game of hand management. Somehow, even though MK is more deterministic than GH (there are no random elements or hidden information in MK), GH feels more like it's about optimization than MK.  This game gets repetitive in a hurry. Each individual session is largely like the one before it,. Sure, the monsters move and attack differently, but \"solving\" the puzzle doesn't feel much different from session to session. If you happen get stuck on a scenario (like, say the very first one), then it can feel like a chore.   The legacy aspects of the game are, of course, dumb. Narrative arc is not a strong suit of board game designers, but I don't expect much out of them anymore. The storyline here is simply a framework for the campaign, which is where the \"game\" is. Level up your characters and go kill some monsters, level up some more.

The rest is drawing 2 random event cards that will add a tiny amount of \"life\" into the world providing you with very limited choices (1 or 2) which result in money gain/loss and buff/penalties. Rare instances, your character you play determines the outcome.  *fantasy themed setting. It could have been any setting since the theme doesn't really do anything to the game play.  *Character development. Take forever to make any changes and even longer to make changes that have significant impact. In any case, you still are doing the exact same thing for each session you play.  *No dice. Instead you have decks of cards. Many decks of cards. Lots of drawing, and shuffling which slows the pace of the game.  *Game sessions have a timer based on your character you play. As you play your character will get exhausted to the point they are forced to end a session in failure. Interesting concept in principle, but practical it means you can't make sub-optimal plays if you want any semblance of rewards, which there is very little of. Because of this mechanism, the game is more of a puzzle than an adventure game. Not all characters are equal in their ability to remain in the game.  *Unlockable content. If you play for long enough you may get to open up new content that is boxed within the game. In all honesty, none of the content that locked away makes an impact on the campaign, so feel free to look at everything the game has within at any time. All aspects are gated off from reach until you meet certain prerequisites. In fact, you may want to do so if you want to try out specific characters or get a hold of specific gear. If you love monotony, you may even want to know how to unlock even more of the same scenarios.  *Component-wise it feels moderate. Not worth the money spent on it.  In short, there are better dungeon crawl games out there.   ", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "brandon75689", "rating": "4", "comment": "Since there are way more cons than pros we will start with that first.  Cons-  The mechanics to me feel a little empty. Many house rules are needed and a lot of the feeling you get of character customization was ruined with admin and severely limiting cards and odd balance choices.   I saw many mistakes on different cards balancing wise and the game can be a little too RNG at times. Majority of the hex moving and AI focus mechanics are fine. But the lack of diversity in AI of them all doing the same thing gets boring and the abundance of \"Kill all enemies\" scenarios is very poor too. To add insult to injury, you are killing many enemies with your health not being a problem. It is more about the cards in your hands, which for me, takes away the immersion and theme of killing things and trying to survive. Makes the game feel very Eurogame. Trying to prolong the happening of player elimination and seems to deemphasize the concept of death and combat conflict.  The game seems to go the \"puzzle\" route but the puzzle that the game wants you to figure out is just never fun to me. The map scenarios are decently sized and with stamina being your \"health\", it makes it even more tedious and unfun to try to maintain your stamina to move through all of the terrain. Especially in the \"kill all enemies\" scenarios and even more so that movement cannot be split up. You either do or you don't.   I feel the lack of character uniqueness was also troubling. Some of the characters are just crazy strong and half of the others are very underwhelming. Usually in games like this, you need the holy trinity at the least in order for things to work. But in this game its mostly all about killing as fast as possible. CC is borderline not there till you spend tons of gold to get it and tanking is a afterthought. Even the character you thought would be the tank is actually another person who can fight just as good as the DPS classes.   It is also weird that as you level up, the vanilla alternatives on the cards stay attack 2 and move 2. I would think the cards would go up in power. But I found that many times, I would level up to be underwhelmed and happen to stick with cards a level or 2 lower than all the cards I just unlocked.      +Pros-- Its not too much of a burden on me if you have good friends that will play through. Lots of time and care went into the game and you won't find many games like it in the sense of how it is thematically in this Sub-genre of boardgames. Which is a feat and also depressing.   The art is great and the amount of tiles and different monster standees and city/road event cards make for a somewhat stale (Because of repeating side stories) but decent filler in between storyline.  Plenty of content to have a group of friends do game night with it for sometime.   ~~Conclusion.  Overall it is okay. I think the massive scale of the game and the amount of authoring that went into it for its lore and IP is why the games rating is so high. It's being fairly ambitious with its content and whats its trying to do. I do not blame them for what they are trying to do. I understand it is hard to essentially replace a DM in a D&D game where the options for story are infinite. But this is great for people who are not story tellers. I think it is also a good Gateway game for the genre. It seems heavy, but I do not think the weight rating is accurate on BGG. I think questions will arise when playing this game that aren't answered in the rules. This game will definitely need a 2nd edition.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

I hate the legacy element; the designer said he would make files available to replay, but it takes a lot of work and it needs to be done upfront. Rulebook is a slog, and has several confusing or clearly wrong rules. Gameplay is heavy on planning and number-crunching, low on theme. (There is however a ton of poor and irrelevant flavor text). Character advancement seems focused on people who want to do advanced math analysis. Feels like the a lot of effort went in to making the game hard to replay, but very little into making it easy to play. Town/City cards are awful; might as well just roll a die to see what random bonus/penalty you get, since the choices are meaningless. However, the actual core gameplay was pretty cool. Tough decision making and planning (probably tougher since we didn't bother to pre-plot everything like you probably should).  +co-op+", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}
{"username": "C3Gaming", "rating": "3", "comment": "I wanted to like this game - the concept was cool, and who doesn't get excited over a big box of goodies? And there's some unique design elements here too. I would've rated this higher, but I wanted to make sure my opinion on the game, and additional plays have just made me hate it. Absolutely no desire to play ever again.  Gameplay is super slow. Takes several turns to kill even small mobs (bar good luck/burning a strong attack), and even the smallest, most forgettable dungeon is going to take 2+ hours. And heaven forbid you fail a mission, then that session feels like a complete waste of time, and you have to slog through the same crap again next play.  That's without mentioning the campaign itself, where progress is a crawl. How often are you playing this? Weekly? Get ready for it to take a month for you to gain any sort of benefit. And anywhere from 6-12 hours of gameplay. Playing an MMORPG here. And then when you do gain a benefit, it's what, one or two new items (with a limit on how many you can carry), one new skill? With 17 characters to cycle through, there's no way it needed progress this slow. It's a bummer, as the campaign largely feels tacked on, and frankly, I think GH plays better as a one-shot game. Just choose a scenario, the characters you want to use, and scale appropriately. Way more engaging.  The allure of campaigns, and many games in general, is the sense of progress they can give you. Gloomhaven's core gameplay is the opposite of this (starting with a hand of options that dwindles as time goes on) without giving players feedback that makes them feel like they're making progress. So that's what the campaign is for! But it's so slow-going, it just feels like a slog. Gloomhaven, more like Grindhaven.  But what's worse, as a game that's marketed as a Euro, the second coming of Mage Knight, etc, etc... is the luck factor is worse than most dice-driven games I've played, between its randomizer decks, unpredictable monster priority/movements, and chaos of co-ordination. (Though ultimately that co-ordination does give players agency and avoids quarterbacking to some degree - it would be fine by itself, but annoying with the other luck factors.) And in a game that's this tight, a bit of randomness can flip a scenario from a win to a loss.  The randomizer decks are hot garbage. A friend I was playing with couldn't stand them after 2 plays. When you roll dice, you can predict the results. With this, it's pretty much even chance you'll get good or bad luck. Completely random. If you get your critical/miss cards, the deck recycles, so it doesn't even accomplish the advantage of using cards over dice - that a slew of bad luck can be rectified by a slew of good luck.  And what's worse, is bad luck is just plain worse than good luck. The game incentivizes you to optimize and plan out your attacks. So when you get a -1 on your carefully planned attack, you'll not only have to waste turns trying to kill something, but probably be wasting resources taking a hit. +1, +2 or even a double attack? More often than not, it just uselessly overkills an enemy.  And then you have perks. What is the goddamn point, of having luck just so you can mitigate it as time goes on? Just don't have it in the first place! It's not a reward, it's an artificial design handicap to give players the illusion that they're making progress. Just lazy.  The gameplay can feel pretty limiting too. Quite often you'll look at your cards thinking \"I want to do this, but I can't\". I do generally prefer games that give you the ability to do what you want on a turn (with action points or something, so you still have to choose between what you want to do), but it does go a way into making characters feel distinct, and is a neat puzzle.  For more material things, it's also a chore to set up (though I was enjoying that more than the gameplay by the end), the component quality is iffy (though acceptable given the amount of stuff) and the board's utterly useless. Just track your progress on paper like a big girl (you have to for the individual characters anyway). Player envelopes are useless too, they just make it take longer to setup.  Oh, and whilst the art is pretty nice (admittedly not a high fantasy fan, but it's kinda unique even if it's just the same spin on regular fantasy tropes), the theme is dry as bones. Little sense of immersion here. You have some nice theming on character/enemies, but it largely feels mechanical.  I hope designers take a look at Gloomhaven's success and can pull it off better. Having your game require thought to play is a good thing, but bad when it doesn't reward you for it. Difficulty is compelling, but not when you have to redo a scenario when you lose. And there absolutely should be a priority on giving players gameplay content for the cost, rather than just bling.  For a campaign game that's punishing, but also gives you a good sense of progress and has a good mix of quick battle tactics and long form strategy over the course of several play sessions, look at Kingdom Death: Monster.  For a thinky dungeon crawl that rewards player skill, has a good sense of progress over a single session, and enables a ton of player agency, Mage Knight is uncontested.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Larry Chong", "rating": "3", "comment": "I love dungeon and fantasy themed games but this doesn't seem enjoyable for me. Gloomhaven falls short of my expectations and I really wanted to like this. I feel like it's a \"Robo Rally\" pre-programming, diminishing-deck dungeon crawler, that has too much cerebral deck-analysis that feels too rushed and thinky to be fun. (BTW, Robo Rally is not my cup of tea.)   I played this in two-players mode after we researched how to optimize characters.   My biggest displeasure with Gloomhaven is it's pace.  It's more of a dungeon blaze-through then a dungeon-crawl explorer.  The pace of going through each dungeon is too rigidly \"forced\" upon the players by limiting your hand-size via a diminishing or deconstructing hand mechanism. It's a deliberate fast-paced timer which reinforces that \"rushed sense of urgency\" in nearly ALL scenarios. Again, it feels very artificial to me.  It seems that the lowest/weakest hand-sized character really dictates the party's speed or pace for how quickly the party needs to move through each dungeon or else risk running out of cards. Now, that's indeed a very sad way of failing as true Adventurers!  \"Oh, no!   We failed b/c our (wizard or rogue) ran out of (wait for it...) ....cards?!?\"  The difficulty of the dungeons are usually very difficult, and in combination with the amounts of time it takes to administer all the components/card decks and the fast-paced at which you need to rush into each scenario (hand limitations), that really offsets most of the other fun factors that I liked about it.  Thus, it diminishes or minimizes my overall enjoyment in contrast with the length of this type of game.    The \"not being able to trade items\" with fellow party members, and other quirky rules, does not make any thematic or realistic sense either.  They're just \"Euro rules\" thrown in to \"balance\" things out so the system can't be exploited.  In other words, the system is kind of broken-ish and uses Euro rules to tweak it together.  I expect better from thematic dungeon/adveneture games.    I also did not feel like there was high amounts of a co-op aspect.  It feels like if you are the character w/ the lowest or weakest hand/size/management, then you dictate what you \"need\" to do and everyone else has to (co-op) \"work around\" that player's circumstances.  It's more a co-op for everyone else, really.    For the high volume time commitment spent playing it, I feel that I received little benefit gained for my character via the gaming experience.  (At least for the first three levels.  Maybe it's a better game for high level characters but I don't wish to spend the time to get there.)   The production quality of this is mostly outstanding but as a dungeon'fantasy design, it falls flat to entertain me fully with a rich, dungeon/fantasy adventure gaming experience - - especially with the likes of other great games such as:  Descent, Mage Knight, D&D Ravenloft / Drizzt / Ashardalon series, Legends of Andor series, Mice & Mystics, etc. just to name a few in comparison.  I would also count games like Star Wars Imperial Assault, War of the Ring and Star Wars Rebellion as \"similar games\".  Now, I do enjoy a great deal of Euro games and own many in my collection.  But, in retrospect, I think usually I'll much prefer Thematic-dungeon crawlers over Euro-dungeon crawlers like Gloomhaven.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Achire", "rating": "3", "comment": "I feel terrible giving this game such a low rating, because it's clearly a game that a lot of thought & effort went into, and one that many people love. However, I found it painfully boring. It felt like grinding in an old dungeon crawling video game. The monsters are fairly similar to each other, the AI feels somewhat dull, and some characters feel quite disadvantaged for gaining loot (for example, if your character is fragile with  ranged attacks, you have to keep your distance from enemies, which means you never get the loot... a shame. I loved the premise of top and bottom actions, but I didn't find the cards as exciting as I hoped. It's a real masterwork of a dungeon crawling simulator, but at the end of the day, it just felt boring to me and it would be torture for me to play it again. I will not be continuing with the campaign; one of my friends will probably take over my character.   Pros: combines dungeon crawling with multi-use cards and a 'deck is your life' system, nice miniatures, lots of content  Cons: Long and you have to repeat the very dull scenario if you fail, all dungeons feel the same, theme didn't feel especially immersive, the semi-coop of everyone being out for themselves is annoying as your teammate steals a coin from you while you work to help the team; I'd rather be competing or cooperating, downtimes can get very lengthy if someone is struggling to make a decision, the rewards are dull, and the game is just far too long for what it it.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

If I wanted RNG, dice would be much more suitable, especially for a dungeon crawler. In addition, the modifiers also decide between life and death - and most of the time you'll whiff half of your attacks!   Found the theme to be generally quite dull, and feel that the game is massively over-rated despite the initial value for the entire contents if you backed the KS (\u00a390-\u00a3110).  People who compare this to Kingdom Death: Monster and/or say it is better need a head examination. Perks are pathetically designed, but you'll need them if you ever want to make it through any number of scenarios without getting mauled to death by the number of shoddy modifiers.   The campaign itself SUPER BORING, even the original 8-Bit/16-Bit RPG dungeon crawlers like Final Fantasy had masses of immersion for primitive technology. We are living in the 21st century, using the mightiest platform to promote the modern fantasy genre, and yet a developer has managed to create something worse for something so simple and so hyped! How has this happened!?  I'm not personally a D&D player (or other RPG player for that matter), but I found that there are a lot of twists and turns involved when the Gamemaster is able to freely create an ideal experience.

It has so much content that it's not necessary to buy or generate expansions. 4. There's no dice; (almost) everything that happens is within your control. 5. It can be played by one person.  That being said, in my opinion Gloomhaven has some major downfalls that it's fans gloss over:  1. It's long and not convenient for those with families (our playthrough of the first dungeon lasted over three hours) 2.  Story was not compelling enough for the investment; amount of exposition seemed more appropriate for a game of the length of House on Haunted Hill (30-60 minutes). 3.

{"username": "inthedark", "rating": "3", "comment": "Having played many sessions of this game, and having played years of various tabletop systems including D&D, Pathfinder, Fantasy Age, and Fate Core, I can say that this is an expensive, laborious, restrictive, reductionist version of a tabletop campaign. The story and the world modulation hold some degree of interest, but there is far more that one can accomplish in a tabletop role play campaign - with far less STUFF. There are an insane number of pieces to this game, it takes a very long time to setup, and it is almost impossible to fit back into its original box. I love tabletop games of all types, but if you want to have a role-play campaign, I strongly recommend D&D 5E or Fate Core. If you love complexity, try Pathfinder. There's a system for everyone, and a campaign can be anything you or your friends can imagine!

{"username": "s_o_r_r_o_w", "rating": "3", "comment": "Unfun.  The game is challenging and features innovative mechanics.  However, it is constantly kicking you in your dangly parts and stealing your lunch money.  Random events are almost always negative; even the times when you get some sort of reward, it\u2019s usually accompanied by a downside.  The reward for winning is, in most cases, simply more quests\u2014which are also hard and unfun.  The rewards are not worth the effort.  The \u201cdungeons\u201d are small\u2014necessarily, because the resource management is so intense that one wrong move can mean you have to play the whole scenario over again.  The gold economy is stingy and produces competition between players for the already too-scant loot.  Because your movement is dictated by a card deck, which diminishes every time you play through it, a big part of the challenge is simply having enough cards to move from one end of the map to the other.  There is a theme stapled to the top of the game mechanics, but it doesn\u2019t matter.  Your adversaries are each composed dominantly of abilities that randomize every turn, meaning that strategizing is extremely difficult if not impossible, which is ok since you\u2019re not allowed to closely coordinate with your allies, anyway.  Success in the game ultimately means that the character you\u2019ve slaved to advance gets retired, and, congratulations!  Now you have to start a new character.  I\u2019m reasonably sure that the high reviews are the product of the following scenarios:  1) The game cost a lot, and it should be a good game, right? 2) We\u2019re good at this incredibly difficult game, and that makes us really smart, and so this is a good game! 3) I\u2019ve only opened the box and looked at all the parts\u2014so many parts...in this...good...game....  I found it frustrating, unrewarding, unnecessarily opaque, and, ultimately, boringly uninteresting.  I can\u2019t even be bothered to find out all the \u201csecrets\u201d, because I\u2019m certain they will be pointless and unrewarding.

Grinding is a lazy and manipulative game mechanic and it's used most often when the underlying mechanics aren't that interesting on their own. I feel like Gloomhaven is mostly grinding. The character advancement. The item acquisition. Etc. Take that all out and there's an interesting card-playing puzzle, but that puzzle isn't any deeper or more interesting than the puzzles found in, say, Azul or Sagrada.  I've played several four-player sessions of Gloomhaven. Typically, we'll play for three or four hours, accounting for setup and teardown as well. I find that I end up making only a handful of meaningful decisions over that time period and the rest is spent just going through the motions. It's just a terrible ratio of active gaming to time invested.  I like deep games that maximize interesting decisions and player interaction while minimizing downtime and setup/teardown. Gloomhaven is my personal hell.  Edit:  lots of private messages from Gloomhaven fans made me reconsider my rating.

{"username": "GoingMadlem", "rating": "2", "comment": "If there's one thing I can say about Gloomhaven, it's that this game is ambitious... very ambitious. It's probably the most ambitious dungeon crawl adventure game I've ever played... and I'm not saying that as an accomplishment.   Gloomhaven is like combining D&D with filling out your income tax returns, except you have to use cardboard disks to do all your calculating instead of a calculator. This game combines elements from different genres into a Frankenstein's Monster of dungeon crawl action. I've never been more bored playing a game than during our introduction to Gloomhaven.  The only fun we had during the intro scenario were the few moments of levity we extracted out of the shared misery of painstakingly referencing and re-referencing the rules for the overly complicated combat mechanics over the course of two masochistic hours. We spent more time saying \"what the hell does this card do?\" and trying to keep track of who had what initiative than we did resolving anything that actually progressed the game to a conclusion.  This is the Star Wars prequels of adventure games. You're force-fed a vision of what an adventure is supposed to be like with none of the fun of an adventure. Your decision tree revolves around poorly designed cards that often resulted in our players just moving two spaces and punching a guy because that was often better than the abilities printed on the card... or maybe they didn't, I really don't know what the rest of my group was doing most of the time because I was so bored after spending an hour killing six Bandits that I checked out. I honestly don't know how this dumpster fire of a game got published and I sure can't fathom how it climbed so high on this website.   This is what happens when a game doesn't go through a traditional design process; conceptually this game is fantastic, in practice it's every idea one man ever had thrown into a single box and fused into something resembling a game. \"No\" is not a dirty word and this game would have been a lot better if someone had learned to say it at any point in the design process.  As a game store retailer, I feel obligated to call all of the customers I sold this game to and apologize for taking their money.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "imaginaryforce", "rating": "2", "comment": "Popular doesn\u2019t mean good.   I come from a background of computer RPG games of the likes of Baldur's Gate and I can see how someone not familiar with those games, can find this game thrilling but if you like the idea of turn based combat, leveling up your character and progressing in a story, a boardgame is just not the ideal medium to do that, or at the very least, Gloomhaven is certainly not the ideal way to do that. RPG videogames scratch that same itch just so much better.  Once we get past the mountains of bookkeeping and maintenance around Gloomhaven, all that is left is a repetitive and unbalanced card management game. The core of the gameplay is simply looking through your deck of abilities and execute rules mindlessly. You can't be too strategic and plan ahead and you also can't take risks because the attack modifier is just too unpredictable for you to create any meaningful and reliable strategy.  Having to look through your deck is frustrating, having to operate the enemies is annoying, having to keep track of the damages and debuffs is excruciatingly annoying and finicky. Having to populate rooms once you walk into them midway through the game is anti-climatic and also annoying. Between all the ability decks and attack modifier decks you might end up with literally 15 different decks laying around on the table, are you kidding me?  The ability deck mechanic in this game is completely flawed and just creates a false sense of strategy and options when in the majority of cases, you are always shoved into a corner with one, maybe two actually correct plays to make. I can come up with multiple better ideas in how to force a rotation among abilities better than simply having you lose the card for the scenario simply because it was a good ability. What happened to the dude in a thematic sense? did he forget how to cast a spell? It's a ridiculous mechanic. Perhaps an ability point system could have been used, with better cards costing more AP and not as powerful cards costing less AP. The same exact end result would have been achieved without the demented discard and lost piles. The concept of mana or energy could have also been utilized instead, with powerful cards costing more mana, which then could have been recovered through resting. Again, same end result without cumbersome and constant deck fiddling.  The setup, storing and overhead management of this game is ridiculous (to note that I even bought the Broken Token insert!). All the different decks that need to be managed and stored, with certain attack modifiers being added only in certain scenarios which then need to be removed. Ability decks that get changed and updated. Everything is so cumbersome and it adds nothing to the gameplay itself.  Ultimately, despite my best efforts, I struggle to find a single thing about this game that is fun or well designed. Even the components and artwork is uninspired and mediocre at best. I can also understand why to so many, this seems like a fantastic game. It's the perfect game for gamers who like to be guided into a decision rather than having multiple real options. It's easy, it's comforting and offers that sense of reward and gratification common to role playing games which again, if that's what you crave, try playing some PC RPG games, they scratch that very same itch, times 10. Or, if you are looking for a great co-op boardgame, with meaningful decision-making and a legacy component that actually changes and evolves the gameplay itself, then try Pandemic Legacy.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Leaving aside the weird, NPC-type character races (your choices are quite limited up front) and the badly-organized box (its half-assed attempt to provide some sort of organizational structure for the myriad decks of cards is insulting), my problem with this game comes down to the opening scenario. To say it is brutally difficult is an understatement. It is downright impossible. Changing strategies, characters, skill/spell loadouts, all yielded fast, frustrating death, if not in the first room, soon upon entering the second room of three. Forget trying to meet the (randomly-generated and very, VERY odd character goals) for the scenario. You'll need to seriously ratchet down the difficulty, beyond what the game even allows, basically house-ruling a way to win the first scenario. IE, the only way to win that first scenario is to cheat. What a fun way to play a game.  After running into loss after loss on the first scenario, I boxed this game up, sold it, shipped it, and never looked back.  There is no reason for a game to punish players who have just started. It's bad game design. A well-designed game can teach as it goes, introducing players to the complexities of gameplay as it progresses. A dedicated gaming group will not tolerate a game that dishes out constant losses, no matter how good it might get later on. There will be the inevitable responses of \"get gud,\" etc, but a game has to have a hook to draw gamers in. This has only disappointment and frustration at the outset.

If you want a tactic miniatures games, maybe this is a good option, but if you want a game filled with theme and different stories... I also found quite abstract and stupid the initiate system and the simultaneous card choice.  UPGRADE: I really enjoyed LOtR: Journeys in Middle Earth, even though it is a much simpler game.

{"username": "Poptech", "rating": "1", "comment": "[b]Don't forget to rate this a 10 when you pre-order![/b]  The over-hyped, ginormous box of disappointment that will appeal to people who need an RPG cheat code. Nothing says \"adventure\" like reading your dungeon master's scenario before ever playing it. With Gloomhaven you will never be surprised by the location of traps, treasure or monster encounters ever again because you will know exactly where they all are before you even start. What a challenge!  When paying over $100 for a board game, a box this big better be stocked full of miniatures but sadly it is not and you only get them for your characters. Yet somehow poor artwork, an uninspired fantasy setting and a depressingly lame game title gets this ranked in the top 100 with less than 2000 ratings? This is what happens when a good portion of the gaming community has not had the chance to properly critique an over-hyped game and the reviews only come from its Kickstarter echo-chamber.  I assume its legions of fanboys must justify their investment because when have we seen a top 100 game get over 65% perfect 10's? (Nov 2017 update: holding strong at 58%) When the #1 game on the list - Pandemic Legacy can only justify 38% perfect 10's, it may be time to implement a vote threshold above the number of Kickstarter backers a game has in order for it to reach the top 100 and reduce gaming of the BGG rankings by large crowdfunding campaigns.  I shook my head in utter disbelief watching the incredibly lame Kickstarter trailer for this game. It was nothing but a childishly recycled mishmash of fantasy cliches, yet praised as original. Have people lost their minds?  Apparently so because this nonsense continues with the amateurish looking world map that has areas titled: \"Dagger Forest, Watcher Mountains, Merchant's Bay, Misty Sea, Lingering Swamp, Still River and yes even Serpent's Kiss River.\" Those do not even sound believable for a fantasy setting. It is as if the designer asked some kids in 5th grade to name everything in the game.  Speaking of which, nothing says fun and excitement like putting stickers on your game components to play a \"legacy\" game and destroying its ability to be replayed. It must remind players of those oh so cool gold stars they would get in elementary school.  I've seen reviews falsely calling this \"D&D in a box\" which is disingenuous, it is not possible for any board game to be compared to an RPG when you lack fundamental character creation. Most dungeon crawl board games are devolved, uninspired RPGs that rip out what made them unique and leave in a pre-made, scripted and poorly designed shell.  Gloomhaven is much worse than a traditional RPG and most other dungeon crawl board games since it allows you to effectively cheat by knowing the entire layout of a scenario ahead of time. This includes every location you will move into, where all the treasure is located, where all the traps are located and where all the enemies are located that you will be fighting. What is the point of a trap if you know where it is? How can you call something an \"adventure\" when you know about everything that is coming next? How hard is it to plan for future enemy encounters in a scenario when you can see through walls? Having an unfair advantage like this should appeal to people who are poor tacticians yet falsely believe themselves to be \"tactical geniuses\" and maybe [i]that[/i] is why people are raving about this game.  Thinking a game mechanic is \"clever\" has nothing to do with tactics and nothing about the laughable two card combat system is tactical let alone clever. Using the top and bottom portions of two cards in combat is a handicapping, nonsensical mechanic that stands as one of the worst combat systems I have ever seen implemented in a board game. There is no logical reason why running would prevent me from backstabbing someone on a later turn simply because it was on the same card that has already been used. All this does is add a worthless puzzle mechanic to combat.  While the attack modifier deck is just a lame excuse not to use dice with modifiers that is prone to abuse by failing to properly randomize it due to poor shuffling. So how many players have been given themselves an unfair advantage in Gloomhaven by failing to always [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxJubaijQbI]riffle shuffle their attack modifier deck 7 times[/url]? How far have they unfairly advanced their characters this way? Why not just start over? Oh wait, they cannot since they applied all those stickers. Thanks \"legacy\" games!  Any remote relation to an RPG is further destroyed with your inability to equip any gear you acquire during a scenario or trade anything with another player. What an incredible advancement in game design! You can pick up a sword and carry it around but are unable to swing it at anything to do damage until after the scenario is over. This is clearly something everyone should be very excited to try out! These brilliant design decisions are what clearly makes this a perfect 10 all night long.  Ironically, players who \"love\" this game are likely cheating left and right by failing to follow the \"appropriate communication\" rule on page 17 of the rule book, \"[i]Players should not show other players the cards in their hands nor give specific information about the initiative value or any other numerical value on any of their cards.[/i]\" No wonder solo-gamers rave about this, since talking with yourself can never be considered cheating.  Regarding your heroes, the apparently guilty designers again shoehorn female characters into a game that mostly grown men are going to play but without any choice of gender selection in the sad hope that women are going to really play this dungeon crawl with them this time.  Then we have the character classes where most are not in the least bit original but merely synonyms of standard classes with race prefixes (Brute = Fighter, Scoundrel = Thief, Spellweaver = Mage etc...) Don't fear though, as you can later unlock exciting new classes like the \"[url=http://www.cephalofair.com/gloomhaven-spoilers]Human Sawbone[/url]\" - I cannot make this stuff up. When you have to reach for stuff like this you need to stop trying.  Implementing the absolutely worst idea in the history of board gaming, Gloomhaven has people (owners of the game) talking about \"leveling up\" characters via solo play and then bringing them buffed up to their co-op sessions. Really? Who was the referee to make sure they either actually did what they said, did not cheat, took liberties with the rules or even just innocently played certain rules wrong? You mean to tell me if someone who just spent many hours leveling up a character on their own time gets that character killed and with no one around to see are not going to give themselves a \"do-over\"? Who is to stop someone from just declaring the characters are so without doing anything at all? Oh my friends you do not know human nature.  For over $100 and a box the size of a microwave oven you get to fight against a bunch of cardboard standees while you struggle to keep track of your hit points with a micro-wood counter that either constantly falls out of place or does not fit. Why wood? Because wood is retro man and should hold up well with the card board punch out character card or something. Don't worry though even if this is a crap system fanboys say you should just keep track of your HP in a way other than the game was designed because why pay over $100 for a well designed game?  Speaking of bad game design, when you get a big box you get everything BIG! Including the oversized '70s era plastic stands for the cardboard standees that obscure a third of the artwork and give the game an aura of dollar store quality. Again fanboys ridiculously dismiss that these are \"easily replaceable.\" What part of you just paid over $100 for the game do they not understand? How come I never have to replace any of my Days of Wonder or Fantasy Flight Game components out of the box?  Continuing with flashback's to the '70's, the monster statistics are adjusted by rotating an over-sized square card and sliding it into what looks like a '70's era 8-inch floppy disk envelope. Not thinking this \"idea\" all the way through, as the monsters get more powerful they are rotated, so they wind up looking like they are either drunk or are hanging from the ceiling. Upside down artwork is clearly a sign of premier game design and not a beta version still in development.  But hey, you did get that BIG box right? Only a game like \"Gloomhaven\" can have a box so big yet be so poorly designed that you cannot fit everything back into it without taking a Japanese origami course. Yes that's right the fanboys are so embarrassed to admit it, that they simply leave piles of the game components on shelves and call it a win-win.  Lastly \"Gloomhaven\" takes you back to the '80s with pen and paper character sheets! Something I have been dreaming of ...actually no I have not.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

{"username": "Rosco666", "rating": "1", "comment": "normally i'd play this game as any dungeon crawler i've played already (descent, imperial assault etc,) but this one's story is all but interesting or exciting. The story is just an exscuse for a well placed combat system and the whole game is just this: combat. there's no exploration, the movement system could be removed and all the game could be played as a sequence of pointless fights. THe objective of the missions (i've played 10 scenarios by now) is almost always the same:\" kill every monster, kill every monster) The components are horrible: stand ups, terrain tiles with crappy drawings, card abilities with no imgages, and items card with bad drawings. A dungeon crawler to me is an immersive experience, you have to feel the fact that \"you\" are in the dungeon, struggling with evil forces, doing your specific actions to help your group achieve the pbjective. Gloomhaven has nothing to do with this: is just a game of managing resources (cards) and hope for the best (because even if the whole world is yelling that this game is german, this IS NOT german game, a good dose of luck is needed since a very important and critical attack  (for the mission) could randomly fail and a monster could randomly activate before you go (and you could do nothing to prevent it) and the mission could randomly (and dramatically fail). Yes: it's not like having to throw dices....but the fact that there is randomness is a FACT. Fanboys: accept it. this is NOT a german game, it's more tending to \"germanish\" than most of the dungeon crawler we know. The AI system is simply stupid: every turn each monster randomly ( drawing a card) does something that could be totally useless to it o devastatingly powerful. With no clue (even for the monster). most of the times a monster would trigger a dungeon traps dieying stupidly (even traps that it placed or earlier turns!) this is no Artificial intelligence, is artificial Stupidity. I would give it 6 stars, since it's a game i don't dislike ...but that i don't like neither. But since so many fanboys are unblacing its rating with random and unjustified 10 stars, i'm givin it 1, to restore balance.  ps. oh and by the way: you REST and you lose FOREVER an ability you know: that is SO Stupid on so many levels. like i'm going to bed and tomorrow i'm not able to read or write anymore. this is SO STUPID.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

The author of the game makes digs at D&D and suggests it become rote orc slaying, but that's kinda what this game is. We went though 3 dungeons and it was the same every time. Kick down the door, fight monsters, maybe get loot, level up do again. No role playing, no creative problem solving, no having decent options to choose from for attacks and the remotely fun ones get lost after one use. It's a glorified elaborate dungeon crawler and not even a good one. If you don't like dungeon crawlers don't buy this game.

Any good RPG should make you feel like you're a part of its world, or at least give some degree of immersion, but that's totally lacking here.  The art isn't the best, I hate the standees, the sculpts of the minis are pretty bad, and the map tiles are just a joke.  I also find the card combat system to be one of my least favourite game mechanics of all time.  It's like the opposite of a deck-builder, instead of collecting more cards and feeling more powerful, you're fighting a battle of contrition as you slowly lose cards and, with them, useful things to do.  It's not fun in the slightest.  My hatred for this game is undying.", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}
{"username": "garyjgeoaccess", "rating": "1", "comment": "You've got to be kidding me. How is this the #1 game on BGG? I like complicated games, like Eldritch Horror, but Gloomhaven has maybe the worst set of.rules I've ever seen. This isn't just a bad game. It's maybe the worst gamer's game I've ever played.  Granted there is some charm to opening the character boxes and revealing new cards. I get that. Yes, that part is really cool. But combat is atrocious. And that's 90% of the game! I'd rather play Shadows of Brimstone, where there is some true exploration. Gloomhaven is a simple minded monster slog. Kill everything. (Yeah, even with SOB's horribly clunky game mechanics, I prefer it to Gloomhaven--by a wide margin.)  I've learned a lesson about BGG and I'll be much more careful in the future regarding BGG game rankings.  ADDENDUM: Most people in the game's target audience are probably big fans of dungeon crawlers. I am not. I thought this game would be much more than that. But the basic game mechanics are all about combat. In this game, you slash and hack your way through room after room of monsters. That is not my kind of game. I have no interest in games like this. My mistake was in believing this game was more than just a monster slog. It is not. I will attempt to sell this game. ", "game": "Gloomhaven", "game_id": 174430}

Know this, weary traveller: If you think spending any amount of coin on a piss-poor marriage of Warhammer Quest, Diablo 2 and a random puzzle-based Euro adorned in all the fineries that an overblown KS campaign can afford - meaning stacks of brownish-green cardboard interspersed with depressing shades of blue and red - is your idea of fun, go right ahead.

{"username": "Geeky_Teacher", "rating": "1", "comment": "Overrated, overproduced, underdeveloped, underwhelming, overpriced and overhyped.  In no way is this game #1, nor is it better than Descent or Imperial Assault or Conan. If a Eurogame is deserving of #1, then that would be Terraforming Mars.  Too many have rated it a 10 when they pre-ordered on KS which inflated the rating from day 1. Then, many rated it #1 to justify having it in their collection, or to \"fit in\" because they are sheeples, or to justify being suckered into paying $140 at retail for a blah game. Many have never played it through. Many have never played Descent to know what a good dungeon crawler is like. It may be better than Zombicide or Castle Ravenloft or Dark World but those aren't near the pinnacle of genre. Then there are all of those \"Euro-gamers\" who have never touched a dungeon crawler with a 10-foot pole claiming this to be the best of the genre. Anyway you slice it, the current rating is 100% biased.   (But don't say so in the forums! Bashing this mediocre golden goose might get you banned if the moderator has drunk the Kool-Aid!)  I am glad that Tom Vasel has taken off his rose-coloured glasses and realized that once the cult-of-the-new has faded that this game is not better than Cosmic Encounters.  Many of the game mechanics are fiddly, or make no-sense whatsoever thematically. The monster AI is beyond stupid in this day and age. The designer has never played a board game dungeon crawler and it shows as this seems more in line with a video game, except not every minutiae that a CPU can handle is translatable in a physical game without it becoming a real slog. Every mechanic in this game that was borrowed from other eurogames are the only ones that feel modern, everything else feels outdated and fiddly in comparison to Descent which came out 5 years earlier! And the \"Legacy\" aspect seems like it was tacked on to feel \"modern\" and ride the trend. And don't get me started on the lame nomenclature -- could it be any more generic and unimaginative?  Be warned, and skip this one. Buy Descent or Imperial Assault for a good dungeon crawl campaign made by a tried-and-tested publisher and designers, or even Conan for a good time in a scenario-based game. Or wait for FFG's Lord of the Rings : Journeys in Middle-Earth for a newer game.  My rating should be perhaps at best a 5 for mediocre, which this game is, however, I will always refuse to play this which then makes it a 2 since I won't play it ever again. However, I am rating this a 1 out of spite to offset all of the \"rate it a 10 when you pre-order on KS\" BS, and all of the fanboys who think that it being #1 makes it the second-coming of Christ.

{"username": "Sherbie", "rating": "1", "comment": "Always think for yourself and reason with logic, explore,learn and grow. You will struggle to move  ai consistently and logically by the rulebook. You need to modify rules for yourself to get logical movement. Incomplete ruleset. I was called a troll numerous times even though i was trying to point out inconsistency of rulebook with quiz and FAQs(that they supply in forum but i have never had to refer to, nor should i, the complete set of rules should come with game that you buy, nowhere does it say it does not). Rules in rulebook are the axioms to derive how to play.Downgraded to a 1, was a fan for awhile until i met something quite dangerous online. Be very careful.  At 23 scenarios in, dropped rating to a 1, never to play again, it is pointlezz waste of time. The main reason for the drop, is the monster ai is too hard to determine based on rules. They obfuscate meanings of conditions within multilayered rules and in unexpected sections. See the poor results on monster ai. You need to be the designer to understand the rules and the officials on bgg forum did not open up to any feedback that was negative. It was not a fun community for me to enter into, i came out broken. It is a labourious game, with many scenarios that with 2 to 3 players will take a couple hours from set up to dismantle at least. Some went much longer because of the thinking and actions required. The story is bland but supposed to get better?  The individual scenarios were good challenges, but at the end had to ask, is the time worth it? Being a blend of strategy and luck you cannot be sure which made you successful or fail? Its more a kinda of clever play with statistics, that if you play as best you can you will finally succeed. However each time you try it is a massive amount of time invested. If you fail the same scenario many times, it just feels like a waste. Do you even have the best charecter set? I would guess alot of scenarios i passed were through my mistakes. People claim big things online, they must be so good. Didnt get up to high level characters with heaps of items so maybe it does become no challenge but whats the good of that? Also where did they get all that gold, cheat picking it up at end? Mostly down to statistics, whether it is with cards or dice, i dont care, but i find nothing wrong with those wonderful d&d multi faced dice. This is same but cards.  Way too complicated with unessessary obfuscation that results in inconsistent outcomes.  If you can answer this on your own, kudos to you. You probably like 'PURE' mathematics, logic and reasoning.  The monster ai movement! If am 'muddled' and it is impossible to remove it. And muddle causes disadvantage. Asked the question: How should i move to remove disadvantage? Which answer is best?  A. B and C, you cannot remove muddle therefore cannot remove disadvantage.  B. Dont move,you cannot remove muddle therefore cannot remove disadvantage.  C. Move anywhere,you cannot remove muddle therefore cannot remove disadvantage.  My answer is A and i am told i am wrong? Do you know why?  I suggest dont consider muddle for movement, move as normal, makes it easier and consistent for players, increasing strategy and for no real impact to game otherwise. I would play this way(the rulebook says muddle is a -ve condition to attack). Still wouldnt waste my time, more fun games out there.  If muddle is intended to impact movement it would be simpler just to explain that in muddle description, not sure why rules have been hidden like that, trips up players when they have so much to remember for a round.    Oh and the cardboard is cheap, unlikely to make through your campaign. The figures are cheap more 2d than 3d. The monsters are cardboard that damages trying to stand them up. In the end could not overlook these deficienies when other games are much greater quality for less$. You progress through the game by placing stickers on what looks like an incomplete map. Really! Thats all you accomplish. Can be done in minutes if you like, no need to waste hours of your life. Get your 5 year old to do it.  Very niched, cannot share with casual gamers, wife hated it.
